ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  The distinctly reniform [kidney-shaped] spore is the principal distinguishing character of this rare fungus. Features include 1) resupinate growth on conifers, 2) thin, delicate, waxy fruitbodies that are grayish white to pale ochraceous, and smooth to granulose, the margin not especially differentiated, 3) spores that are kidney-shaped, warted, and amyloid, 4) basidia that are suburniform, 5) gloeocystidia that are numerous, obclavate, clavate, and cylindric, the apex rounded, sometimes with 1-2 small papillate apical appendages, the contents pale yellow and granular in KOH and sulfo-positive or sulfo-negative, and 6) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae richly branched, with clamp connections.^ | The placement of this species is uncertain: Julich suggested Boidinia in 1982, but Eriksson(3) calls it Gloeocystidiellum subasperisporum (mentioning the anomalous suburniform basidia) and Stalpers(3) appears to favor the latter tentatively, based in part on similarity to Gloeocystidiellum porosum. RANGE ^Collections were examined from BC, ON, PQ, and Sweden, (Ginns).
FRUITING BODY  resupinate, adnate [firmly attached], effused [spread out], generally of small dimensions, thin (mostly 0.005-0.01cm), ceraceous [waxy] when wet and alive, subcrustose when dried; grayish white to pale ochraceous; mostly almost smooth; margin not especially differentiated^, (Eriksson), effused, 0.004-0.0225cm thick, ceraceous [waxy], "light buff", "cartridge buff", "cream buff" when dry; "smooth, furfuraceous, neither cracked nor areolate"; margin pruinose, colored as the rest of the surface, (Ginns, herbarium specimens), effused, ceraceous, not cracked; grayish white to pale ochraceous or pinkish buff; even, (Stalpers)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'with somewhat rough spores'
SIMILAR  A. subasperisporus differs from the Gloeocystidiellum porosum group by 1) the thin, granulose fruitbodies, 2) kidney-shaped spores, 3) suburniform basidia, and 4) generally smaller gloeocystidia, (Ginns).

LATIN NAME(S)  Bulbillomyces farinosus  (Bres.) Julich^  Persoonia 8(1): 69. 1974
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  The most obvious feature is the crowded white granules less than 0.1cm across which represent the sclerotial stage, usually on wood. They range from spherical to nearly spherical or pear-shaped. These are more often seen than the sexual stage which consists of thin, soft, waxy, greyish patches tightly attached to wood in wet places.^ | The white sclerotia float away on the water and are dispersed widely when the water level falls again. "It can often be seen in localities that are submerged for a period of a month or more in the autumn or in the early spring, but are dry most of the summer.", (Eriksson(4)). Breitenbach(2) say the granules in the photograph [which is of fresh material] are about 0.01-0.02cm. Eriksson(4) say "reaching 0,4 in diam., when dried smaller". This could mean mm, but their photograph of living material with a 1 centimeter scale shows white granules that reach 0.2cm. RANGE ^The photographs were taken in BC. Collections are deposited from BC at the University of British Columbia. There is a New York Botanical Garden record from WA in 1929. Bulbillomyces farinosus is also known from ON, MA, MO, NH, NY, UT, and VA, (Ginns(5)), as well as Europe (including Switzerland) and Asia, (Breitenbach(2)).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Carcinomyces effibulatus grows as a thin film on the surface of tumor-like growths of the caps and stems of Gymnopus dryophilus.^ |The description is derived from Ginns(6) except where noted. |Liu, X.-Z.(1) resurrected the genus Carcinomyces for a clade containing this species as well as Tremella polyporina and Bullera arundiariae. The genus Syzygospora sensu Ginna(6) has been shown to be polyphyletic (Liu, X.-Z.(1)). MycoBank, accessed January 2, 2022, listed Carcinomyces effibulatus as the current name, but the online Species Fungorum, accessed the same day, listed Syzygospora effibulata as the current name. RANGE ^It is found at least in BC and Sweden.
FRUITING BODY  a thin film on the surface of galls (tumor-like outgrowths) on the surface of Gymnopus dryophilus caps and stems, (Ginns), the macroscopically indistinguishable Syzygospora mycetophila [also known as Carcinomyces mycetophilus] is described as a 0.01-0.05cm thick, glassy, gelatinous, cream-yellow film covering round, wart-like, or brain-shaped to somewhat compressed gelatinous growths (0.5-5cm wide or larger), as many as 35, sometimes fused, on cap, gills, and stem of Gymnopus dryophilus, (Lincoff, but Ginns indicates that the gills are not involved in this species or S. mycetophila)
HABITAT  on Gymnopus dryophilus caps and stems
MICROSCOPIC  spores (5.5)6-8(10) x 1.8-2.5 um, cylindric to narrowly obovate, in side view cylindric, rarely suballantoid (somewhat curved sausage-shaped), broadly attached to basidia; blastoconidia of two types, some nearly round to broadly elliptic, 2-3.5 x 1.5-2 um, "formed by budding from basidiospores or, more commonly, from the apices of conidiophores, others rather few, cylindrical to narrowly ellipsoid, up to 13 x 2 um formed on conidiophores"^; basidia 2(3)-spored, cylindric, (25)35-55 x 5-7 um, sterigmata up to 5(7) um long with the tips containing a refractive oily deposit; hyphae colorless, thin-walled, simple-septate, 2-4 um wide, clamp connections not observed, (Ginns), basidiospores inamyloid, smooth, (Oberwinkler)
NAME ORIGIN  "fibula" means "clasp", "effibulata" refers to the absence of clamp connections
SIMILAR  Syzygospora mycetophila, also known as Carcinomyces mycetophilus, (NB, ON, PQ, NY, NH, VT, Mexico) which also grows on the surface of galls on Gymnopus dryophilus, is indistinguishable macroscopically but has 4-spored basidia, clamp connections, and more ellipsoid spores, (Ginns). |Syzygospora tumefaciens (NB, Denmark, Sweden) which also grows on galls of Gymnopus dryophilus as well as galls of Rhodocollybia butyracea, is indistinguishable macroscopically but has broadly elliptic spores 6-8(9) x 3-4 um, obliquely attached to 4-spored basidia, and has clamp connections, (Ginns). |Syzygospora norvegica (found in Norway) grows on hypertrophied gills of Rhodocollybia butyracea, (Ginns). |Heterocephalacria bachmannii (as Syzygospora) grows on Cladonia lichen and is distinguished from the other heterobasidiomycetes growing on lichen by its aseptate basidia: it has been reported from BC, AK, Europe, Africa (Madeira), Asia (New Guinea), and South America (Guyana), (Hafellner).

Conidia in collections from North America are commonly of the paired, blastic type...those in European collections are of the solitary chlamydospore type...Basidiocarps of European collections appear to be distinctly gelatinous, whereas those from North American are predominantly mucoid, the visible mass being composed mainly of slime and conidia"; Bandoni(9) commented earlier, "In my opinion, the specimens designated as this species in North America do not constitute a single taxon. The basidiospores and basidia are similar in these collections, but the hymenial conidiophores and basidiocarps are of two distinct types.": he goes on to say that specimens from BC include both the sort matching the Bourdot collections and another sort.

Features include 1) (the most distinctive feature) a flaring cup-shaped structure about 0.5cm across, on the upper side of twigs and small branches, in which develops a bright salmon egg-like sclerotium 0.2-0.3cm across, that when mature is loosely attached at the base and easily removed (it is thought that this sclerotium is disseminated by raindrops to other wood where the fruitbody grows), 2) the resupinate fruitbody that grows widely spread out or in irregular patches, and is soft-membranous in consistency, separable, pink in color, with an irregular margin that is abrupt or thinning out, 3) spores that are ovoid with a conspicuous apiculus, smooth, inamyloid, and colorless, 4) basidia arising from deep in the subiculum, 5) abundant paraphyses with irregular peg-like branches, and 6) hyphae with clamp connections.^ RANGE ^Corticium minnsiae is found in BC, OR, ON, PQ, CA, ME, MI, NC, NH, NY, PA, TN, VT, (Ginns), and WA (I. Gibson, pers. comm.)
FRUITING BODY  when mature widely spread out or in irregular patches, 0.013 to 0.02cm thick, soft membranous, separable; "bright pinkish buff to shell pink or pale flesh color when fresh, fading to cream buff or white"; surface at first continuous, becoming rimose [cracked] when old exposing the subiculum; margin "irregular, abrupt or thinning out"; basidial fruitbody preceded or accompanied by a characteristic sclerotial disseminating phase, a small flaring cup-shaped structure on the upper side of twigs and small branches, in which develops a bright salmon egg-like sclerotium that when mature is loosely attached at the base and easily removed^, (Jackson)
HABITAT  a cup-shaped structure on the upper side of twigs and small branches contains sclerotium in August and early September, but is shriveled and dried later in the fall after the sclerotium has been disseminated (perhaps by a similar splashing mechanism from raindrops to the one operating in bird's nest fungi), the resupinate fruitbodies develop in the fall but are generally sterile at first, fruiting in late May or June of the following year; found on Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock), Pinus contorta (Lodgepole Pine), Pinus ponderosus (Ponderosa Pine), Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Abies lasiocarpa (Subalpine Fir)^, (Jackson), also Tsuga heterophylla (Western Hemlock), (Ginns)

NAME ORIGIN  from 'mamma', Latin for 'breast', meaning 'breast-like'
SIMILAR  Entoleuca callimorpha Syd. is described in Rogers, J.D.(5) and collections were examined from Montana and Colorado; as far as they knew it had not been collected in recent times: 1) the ascospores averaged much smaller, (14.5)17.5-20.5(22.0) x (6.5)7.0-9.5 um, than for Entoleuca mammata, 2) spore shape is elliptic to elliptic-inequilateral, with narrowly rounded or broadly rounded ends (as opposed to somewhat rectangular for Entoleuca mammata), (Rogers, J.D.(5)). |E. mammata differs from Hypoxylon spp. in several ways including 1) the stroma does not exude pigments when a small piece is placed in 10% KOH on a microscope slide or watch glass, 2) the ascospore germ slit occurs on the concave side of the pore whereas in Hypoxylon the slit is on the concave side if the spore is inequilateral, 3) immature ascospores bear a cellular appendage, 4) the "ascus tip contains a plug which turns blue in Melzer's reagent, is taller than broad", and is clearly visible at 400x under a microscope, whereas Hypoxylon species "have much reduced disc-like ascus apical structures that are much broader than tall, and are often hard to see even at high magnification", and 5) the anamorph produces bark-rupturing hyphal pegs covered in conidia, unlike anamorphs of Hypoxylon species, (Callan, after Ju and Rogers(1996)).

G. porosum has spores that are less broad in relation to length, (Stalpers). Gloeocystidiellum luridum, G. leucoxanthum, Gloiothele lactescens, and Conferticium ochraceum have smooth spores, and the last two lack clamp connections, (Eriksson(3)). Conferticium ravum lacks clamp connections, (Eriksson(3)).

SIMILAR  Gloiodon strigosus is another species that may be in the Pacific Northwest. According to D. Miller (pers. comm.), one of two different sequences of collections in the Pacific Northwest corresponds to European sequences identified as G. strigosus. Ginns(14) wrote, "Gloiodon strigosus was redescribed by Jahn and Sturm (1983) from European specimens. Their excellent, illustrated account and Canadian specimens in DAOM led me to conclude that G. strigosus differs in (a) occurring on angiosperm wood, (b) having smaller basidiomes, (c) dark brown pileus, (d) spines only 2-6 mm long, (e) distinctly yellow brown skeletals, (f) smaller spores 4.5-6 x 4-4.5 Am, (g) verrucose spores with elongated warts (FIG. 4), (h) lacking gloeocystidia in the hirsute pileus tissue and (i) well-developed context in the pileus."

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Helicobasidium corticioides is the label for a collection by O. Ceska from Vancouver Island, British Columbia at the University of British Columbia (UBC F24797, Mushroom Observer 70008, spores 14-20 x 5-6 with microscopic drawings). It has been recorded also from Alberta, Colorado (holotype), Utah, and Wyoming, (Ginns(5)). It is distinguished from other species of Helicobasidium "by the corticioid aspect of the fructification, the basidia, which are usually coiled or loosely spiralled rather than crozier-shaped, and by the size of the basidia and spores". Spores are 14-22.5 x 6.5-12.5 um, ovoid to cylindric, and adaxially flattened, and basidia arched, loosely spiralled, or forming one or two coils, mostly 2-septate to 3-septate, basal cells 80-160 x 6-11 um.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Helminthosphaeria clavariarum forms a gray to black coating on Clavulina coralloides (caused by formation of their minute fruitbodies), seeming to reduce branching of the tips of the Clavulina, (Trudell). It is found on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides (as C. cristata) and C. cinerea, (Dennis). Black dots may be observed in the coating under a hand lens and are visible in larger digital images.^ | The conidial state, which may be found without perithecia, has been called Spadicoides clavariarum. RANGE ^Helminthosphaeria clavariarum on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides has been vouchered from WA (for instance WTU-F-000133 as Clavulina cristata from WA at the University of Washington, by S. Trudell). It is casually reported more widely on sight in the Pacific Northwest including BC, and a parasitized collection of Clavulina coralloides (as Clavulina cristata) from BC is at the Pacific Forestry Centre. 
FRUITING BODY  perithecia about 0.03cm across, "scattered over a web of dark brown hyphae, superficial or somewhat embedded in the mat", subglobose [nearly spherical], without a distinct papilla; black, covered with spreading hairs^, (Dennis)
HABITAT  on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides (as C. cristata) and C. cinerea, (Dennis)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 10-14 x 6-7 um, broadly fusiform or one-sided, dark brown, non-septate, uniseriate^; asci 8-spored, up to 90 x 8 um, cylindric, stalked; paraphyses numerous; some hairs tapering to a point, others cylindric and bearing elliptic, 1-septate, brown conidia, (Dennis)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'of Clavarias'
SIMILAR  It may be difficult to distinguish Clavulina cinerea macroscopically from parasitized collections of Clavulina coralloides. There is an excellent discussion of this problem in Kuo(7). Helminthosphaeria clavariarum parasitizes both species from the base upwards, rendering them gray to black. 'Under a hand lens, the tiny black dots that form the perithecia of the pyrenomycete can be seen' and under the microscope the differences are obvious. The black dots may be seen on larger digital images. Most Clavulina cinerea fruitbodies, as presented in field guides and on the Internet, 'display grayish to purplish gray (not dark gray or black) colors on the branches and paler surfaces near the base of the mushroom, suggesting that the gray surfaces above do not represent the influence of the parasite, which attacks from the base upward.'. 'However, even if Clavulina cinerea does not (usually) represent parasitization of Clavulina cristata, it may still merely represent a gray and frequently less cristate form or "ecotype" of the latter', (Kuo(7) with Latin names italicized).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'granulose'
SIMILAR  Xylodon breviseta has somewhat smaller spores and a different arrangement of spines: while as a rule these are +/- far apart in H. granulosa and the smooth hymenium remains clearly visible between them, they are close together in X. breviseta so that the hymenium is almost covered up, (Breitenbach). X. breviseta can be similar but H. granulosa is usually recognizably different due to its whitish even fruitbody with sparse distinct spines and continuous subicular hymenium; however, some forms are close to X. breviseta and then the subtle microscopic differences must be used: X. breviseta has slightly smaller spores and less dense, more distinct hyphae, (Eriksson). Hyphodontia spathulata generally has flattened spines that are longer, and projecting hyphae are somewhat different, (Eriksson).

SIMILAR  Hypocrea americana and Hypocrea protopulvinata are closely related and the habitat is on polypores in both cases. H. americana has part-ascospores that are subglobose to rhomboidal, measuring (1.7)2.63.8(6.2) x (2.4)3.24.2(5.4) um. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from AZ, NH, NM, and NY. Hypocrea protopulvinata has dimorphic smooth spores with the distal part nearly round, (3)3.3-3.9(4.3) x (2.6)3-5(4.2) um, and the proximal part elliptic, sometimes nearly round, (3.2)3.6-4.2 (4.8) x (2.4)2.7-3.3(3.8) um. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from MD, NY, OH, and Japan. Hypocrea citrina (Pers) Fr. sensu Overton et al. is also closely related but is white to yellow and grows flat on leaf litter, soil, bark, or moss. The part-ascospores have spinulose ornamentation, with the distal part nearly round, sometimes subelliptic, (3.2)4.1-5.2(6.3) x (2.9)3.7-4.8(5.7) um, and the proximal part elliptic, sometimes nearly round to ovate, (3.3)4.4-6(7.1) x (2.5)3.3-4.9(6.3) um. H. citrina has been reported from the Pacific Northwest but the sense is unknown: the name has often been used with the synonym Hypocrea pulvinata to cover both fruitbodies that grow on polypores and those that grow elsewhere. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from GA, KY, NC, NY, OH, and Europe, and the range includes Japan. Hypocrea rufa has been reported by Oluna Ceska from British Columbia (collections at the University of British Columbia) and a collection from Washington is at the New York Botanical Garden. Fruitbodies are red-brown (with the margin white when young), hemispherical to plate-like, and grow on damp wood or wet bark, or occasionally on old fungi or other plant remains. Hypocrea gelatinosa has cushions up to 0.2cm with dark green spots (because of spores) on a pale yellowish background and grows on wood. Hypocrea aureoviridis has disc-shaped bright yellow to brownish fruitbodies up to 0.5cm across, and also has dark green spots. Both of these have been reported from British Columbia by Oluna Ceska (collections at the University of British Columbia). O. Ceska has also deposited at the University of British Columbia a collection from British Columbia of Hypocrea moravica on a rotting branch of Alnus rubra (on bark and branchlet portions). Hypocrea patella has yellow plate-like fruitbodies on wood (with a definite border) - collections from British Columbia at the University of British Columbia are identified as this species.

LATIN NAME(S)  Hypomyces chrysospermus  Tul.  group^  Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. IV. 13: 16. 1860;  == Apiocrea chrysosperma  (Tul.) Syd. & P. Syd.;  = Hypomyces boletinus  Peck
ENGLISH NAME(S)  bolete-eater, golden bolete-eater
NOTES  This taxon is designated as a group so that it includes Hypomyces microspermus (see separate description) which is difficult to distinguish and was at one time considered a small-spored form of Hypomyces chrysospermus. |The descriptions below are specific to Hypomyces chrysospermus itself except probably for Arora's. |Features include 1) a three stage mould-like growth on fungi of Boletaceae, the first white, the second yellow, and the third (seldom seen) red-brown and pimpled, and 2) spores in the white stage that are elliptic, colorless and smooth (conidia), in the yellow stage round, yellow, thick-walled, and warted ("aleuriospores"), and in the final (sexual) stage spindle-shaped, colorless, and usually 1-septate (ascospores).^ |Hypomyces chrysospermus is not edible (Arora). |The anamorph of H. chrysospermus is common, but the teleomorph is uncommon, (Poldmaa). The commoner anamorph stage of Hypomyces chrysospermus is known as Sepedonium chrysospermum and the anamorph stage of Hypomyces microspermus is a similar Sepedonium. |The subicular hyphae in H. chrysospermus are 2-2.5 um wide but when old many cells become irregularly inflated; in H. microspermus, the subicular cells are 3-5 um wide. |Six other Hypomyces species growing on boletes in the United States are described in Rogerson(1). Like H. chrysospermus and H. microsporus, they start with a white subiculum on the surface of the bolete, but they have a different range of features, including a) the width of the subicular hyphae, b) the color of the subiculum that develops, c) the features of the usually round or nearly round "aleuriospores" of the second anamorph stage, d) the features of the sexual stage, and e) sometimes in the species of bolete involved. |The sexual stage is uncommonly observed because by the time it develops, the original bolete and the subiculum is often not evident. RANGE ^Collections of Hypomyces chrysospermus were examined from NF, ME, NC, NH, NY, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Japan, Nepal, Australia, and New Zealand, (Rogerson). H. chrysospermus has also been found in NC, Cuba, northern Africa, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia, (Poldmaa), and CA (Siegel). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia and from AK at the University of Washington, but there is no indication in the online records that ascospores were measured to distinguish H. chrysospermus from H. microspermus. A collection at the University of Washington from Washington was previously identified as Hypomyces lactifluorum which seems an unlikely confusion. There are two more collections from WA at the University of Washington deposited under the yellow anamorph name Sepedonium chrysospermum, which presumably could represent either Hypomyces chrysospermus or Hypomyces microspermus. Hypomyces chrysospermus may occur more widely in the Pacific Northwest and in other areas of the United States (see Mushroom Observer for instance), but needs to be better documented especially considering the similarity to the common Hypomyces microspermus.

LATIN NAME(S)  Hypomyces microspermus  Rogerson & Samuels^  Mycologia 81(3): 426. 1989
ENGLISH NAME(S)  bolete-eater
NOTES  Features of the usually observed stages are a white mold that gradually covers a recognizable bolete fruitbody, than starts turning bright yellow to golden, the bolete fruitbody often collapsing into decay.^ | It is very similar to Hypomyces chrysospermus and we have included it in a Hypomyces chrysospermus group because of the difficulty of telling them apart. In Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast, Siegel(2) say, "This common bolete-parasitic mold goes through two asexual-sporulating stages leading up to the sexual stage, which is rarely observed (the host is often buried in duff by this point)." The sexual stage is a reddish brown, pimply crust (Siegel(2)). The description is from Rogerson(1) except where otherwise specified. RANGE ^Collections were studied from MA (holotype), CA (Del Norte County in extreme northwest of state), QC, CT, ME, MI, NC, NH, NY, NY, OH, PA, VA, WV, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zealand, (Rogerson). H. microspermus has been reported from PQ, CA, CT, MA, MD, MI, NC, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, WV, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zealand, (Poldmaa).
FRUITING BODY  subiculum "at first white, becoming pale yellow"; perithecia spherical to ovoid, "yellow, buff, deep peach, red, brick red, orange-red, cinnabar red, reddish brown, pale brown, blackish brown when dry, often turning purplish red in 3% KOH"^, (Rogerson), second stage "bright yellow to golden colored"; odor indistinct to putrid, spore deposit white in first stage, golden yellow in second stage, (Siegel)
HABITAT  on many species of the Boletaceae
MICROSCOPIC  SPORES in white stage 5-17 x 3-7 um, "oblong to broadly elliptic", in yellow stage 8.5-15 um in diameter, "round, distinctly spiny, very thick walled", in sexual stage 8-15 x 2.5-4.5 um, "spindle to lance shaped"^, (Siegel), SPORES: CONIDIA 11-14 x 4-5 um, elliptic, 1-celled, "held in colorless slime heads at tips of macronematous, irregularly to verticillately branched, septate, hyaline conidiophores", ALEURIOSPORES 12-15 um in diameter, round, wall about 2 um thick, "usually prominently warted, bright yellow, golden yellow or yellow orange", warts 1-1.5 um high and often truncate; ASCOSPORES (8)10-15 x (2.3)3-4 um, "naviculate, fusiform-ellipsoid", "smooth or verrucose", verrucae less than 0.25 um high, apiculi less than 1 um long, bicellular, "septum usually submedian giving two unequal cells" (upper cell 6-8 x 3-4 um, lower cell (2.3)4-5(6) um), "sometimes median giving two equal cells, sometimes lacking and ascospores remaining unicellular", spores "uniseriate in the ascus, the ends overlapping"; ASCUS (110)112-120 x 4-6 um, cylindric to clavate, wall somewhat thickened, with apical pore; PERITHECIA (230)305-315(400) x (180)240-250(330) um, spherical to obovoid, perithecial wall 20-25 um wide, cells 6-10 x 2-3 um, walls less than 0.5 um thick, papilla 80 um high and 100 um wide at base, terminal wall cells 4-7 um in diameter, +/- clavate; SUBICULAR HYPHAE 3-5 um wide. (Rogerson)
NAME ORIGIN  "refers to the small ascospores"
SIMILAR  Hypomyces chrysospermus differs most obviously in the ascospores [although these are not often available] which rarely range below 20 um, "are prominently verrucose, and unequally bicellular", whereas ascospores of H. microspermus rarely range above 15 um in length, "are not prominently verrucose, and vary from equally bicellular to unequally bicellular". Aleurospores and conidia of H. chrysospermus average somewhat larger, but measurements overlap. (Rogerson(1)). Hypomyces chrysospermus is much less common in California but is "only reliably distinguished by its much larger spores" which measure (10)12-25 um, (Siegel(2)).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'pulverulent' (powdery)
SIMILAR  L. pulverulenta generally has a thicker context, a darker spore-bearing surface, and darker spores than other species of Leucogyrophana, (Ginns(15)). Leucogyrophana mollusca has, in contrast to L. pulverulenta, 1) a thin context, 2) a spore-bearing surface that is, when fresh, moist and shiny, 3) a different configuration (3-dimensional contours) of the spore-bearing surface, 4) hyphal strands that are rather obvious microscopically, and 5) slightly broader spores that are pale yellow and dextrinoid, (Ginns(15)). Leucogyrophana romellii has 1) a more thin and fragile nature than L. pulverulenta, 2) a different configuration (3-dimensional contours) of the spore-bearing surface, and 3) spores measuring 4.4-6.0 x 3.2-4.4 um "with the wall dextrinoid perhaps only weakly so and a buff spore print", (Ginns(15)). Hydnomerulius pinastri, like L. pulverulenta (and L. mollusca) occurs on wood in buildings, but H. pinastri has 1) thinner context up to 0.1cm, 2) an odontioid, yellow to olive-yellow-brown spore-bearing surface, 3) usually black hyphal strands between the substrate and the context, 4) sometimes black sclerotia, 5) paler, slightly shorter (about 5-6 um) spores, and 6) broad, parallel hyphae in the trama, (Ginns(15)).

NAME ORIGIN  after Lars Gunnar Torgny Romell (from Sweden, born 1891) who interpreted this species as the same species as Leucogyrophana mollusca
SIMILAR  Leucogyrophana mollusca and L. sororia have a spore-bearing surface that is "shiny, tough, and brittle", whereas in L. romellii it is "typically dry, dull, fragile, and crustose"; furthermore, L. mollusca further has large spores, and L. sororia has 1) narrower spores, 2) a translucent spore-bearing surface, and 3) a lack of roughened, stauroid crystals in the context, (Ginns(15)). Leucogyrophana lichenicola is a similar species that has been described from NT, ON, PQ - it differs in being lichenicolous (undersides of hyphal mats of Stereocaulon and Cladonia), in producing brightly colored (pale yellow to bright orange) sclerotia, and in certain culture characters (Thorn(6)).

The pink to light red to light orange cushions of the conidial state (known as 'coral spot') are usually associated. These anamorphs are Tubercularia vulgaris or close spp.^ |Hirooka(1) examined and sequenced collections labeled as this species and found at least four species: 1) Nectria dematiosa (up to 2-septate ascospores, stemless anamorphs, known from British Columbia, Poland, Japan, and New Zealand), 2) Nectria cinnabarina (up to 2-septate ascospores, anamorph fruitbodies predominantly (70%) long-stemmed, known from eastern North America and Europe), 3) Nectria nigrescens (up to 3-septate ascospores - 4% are 3-septate. 5% 2-septate, anamorph fruitbodies that are 65% short-stemmed and 35% long-stemmed, known from eastern North America and Europe), and 4) Nectria asiatica (up to 1-septate ascospores, anamorph fruitbodies short-stemmed, known from China and Japan). |The length of the stems is not specified but the illustration of N. cinnabarina appears to show a stem almost as high at the rest of the fruitbody and almost as wide across as the fruitbody is across. Note that the stems of the stemmed anamorph antibodies may be obscured by masses of conidia so that they appear to be stemless. |Note also that there are subclades within N. dematiosa that could represent separate species, but evidence is insufficient.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features of the Nemania serpens complex include 1) growth on many kinds of wood, in the form of rounded to oval, coal-like crusts that can coalesce to cover large surfaces, the dark brown to black surface carpeted with dots representing the openings of the perithecia, 2) an absence of pigments released in 10% KOH (presence of these pigments being a general feature of Hypoxylon species), 3) spores that are usually within the range 10-18 x 4-7.5 um, and brown, with an inconspicuous or conspicuous germ slit, 4) the ascus tip blueing in iodine in some species.^ |Miller, J.H.(1) used the name Hypoxylon serpens in this wide sense that has been considered untenable by more recent investigators: Rogers, J.D.(3) and Ju(4) favor a narrower concept and refer for descriptions to Petrini(1) and to Granmo, A., T.

It also occurs in Norway (Ju). Note however that while Ju(4) states that the type of H. atropurpureum var. brevistipitatum in Petrini(1) is Nemania serpens var. colliculosa, Petrini(1) synonymizes Sphaeria colliculosa Schwein. with Hypoxylon serpens, so that it is possible some of the records above for Nemania serpens var. serpens are actually Nemania serpens var. colliculosa. Another variety of Nemania serpens is var. hydnicola (Schwein.) Y.-M. Ju & J.D.

NOTES  Features of this rare fungus include 1) resupinate growth on wood, 2) a fruitbody that is ochraceous flesh-color, the margin whitish and fibrillose, 3) cylindric, slightly curved spores, 4) encrusted cystidia of 2 types as well as thin-walled cystidia, and 5) a dark, semi-opaque zone next to the substrate.^ |The description is derived from Burt. Ginns(5) says the following. The two specimens cited in the protologue are 1016 and 1025. Burt apparently regarded 1025 as Peniophora cinerea, and presumably that is why he designated Ravenel 78, labeled as C. carneum, as type and based the description on that and a specimen from Cuba. Hjortstam studied those two California specimens cited in the prologue, concluding 1016 was indeterminate and 1025 was not Peniophora cinerea. But it is uncertain whether the two collections Burt used are conspecific with 1025: if 1025 can be used to characterize the species, Burt's designation of Ravenel 78 as type is irrelevant. (Ginns(5)). RANGE ^It has been found in WA, CA, and TX, (Ginns). It is found in Texas and Cuba (Burt).

NOTES  "Its most noteworthy character, by which it may be recognized at a glance, is its curious habit of forming the fructification on bark-covered limbs between the bark and the wood, so that the loosened bark - very noticeable on Quercus limbs - curls back, disclosing the fructification closely adnate on the wood.", (Burt, hyphen replaced by long dashes and genus name italicized). Other features of Peniophora decorticans include 1) color that is pale pinkish buff and pale gray to whitish, 2) antler-shaped paraphyses and 3) encrusted cystidia, seen only in the region next to the bark.^ | The description is derived from Burt(7).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Peniophora pithya is somewhat macroscopically similar to Amylostereum and Veluticeps species, "which, however, form distinctly thicker fruiting bodies with projecting margins and a tendency toward semipileate growth", and are microscopically different, (Breitenbach). Peniophora piceae differs by lacking sulfocystidia and by the marginal zone clearly detaching, (Breitenbach). Peniophora septentrionalis has a fruitbody that is lighter in color and less firmly attached, (Eriksson). Peniophora exima H.S. Jacks. & Dearden, found on Abies magnifica in California, differs in having much shorter, almost elliptic spores, (Eriksson). Spores of P. exima measure 5.5-6.5 x 2.5-3 um (Jackson(4)).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'related to, neighboring'
SIMILAR  Phanerochaete sordida and Phanerochaete velutina can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach). P. sordida and P. velutina have cystidia that are less narrow and less tapering than in P. affinis, (Eriksson). P. velutina may be similar and like P. affinis has a fibrillose or cordonic margin, but P. velutina 1) is tan to pale tan to brownish red to burgundy (often with a violet tint), whereas P. affinis is usually orange brown to brownish orange, 2) has cystidia mostly greater than 9 um wide, whereas those of P. affinis are up to 8 um wide, and 3) usually possesses white cordons, (Burdsall). P. sordida 1) lacks a fibrillose to cordonic margin, 2) is usually less orange than P. affinis, and 3) has a different subiculum: P. affinis has a more compact and somewhat agglutinated subiculum with less rigid-appearing hyphae, whereas P. sordida has a more lattice-like appearance, (Burdsall). |Cylindrobasidium laeve can be macroscopically similar, but is easy to separate microscopically, (Breitenbach).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Phanerochaete sanguinea is easily recognized in the field by the combination of reddish or red-spotted surface, reddish rhizomorphs, and reddish-stained wood, (Breitenbach). The red color can be seen at least in the rhizomorphs or as patches on the surface, though young specimens may lack the red (old specimens are wholly red), (Eriksson).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Phanerochaete sordida is distinguished by subicular hyphae that are broad and more or less thick-walled, branched at right angles and running in all directions, forming a well intertwined but open context (rigid lattice-work appearance). Features include 1) resupinate growth on hardwood, occasionally on conifer wood, 2) a fruitbody that is waxy to membranous, soft, whitish cream to ocher, (sometimes tinted yellow to red, at least in the herbarium), and smooth or velvety, with or without cracks, 3) a margin that is narrow and mealy and/or finely fringed, without rhizomorphs, 4) subiculum that is cottony to fibrous, 5) a KOH reaction that is negative or sometimes vinaceous red, 6) spores that are narrowly elliptic, smooth, inamyloid, and colorless, 7) (2)4-spored basidia, 8) cystidia that are projecting, mostly cylindric or fusiform, the tip usually blunt, thin-walled at the apex and thick-walled in the lower part, smooth to strongly encrusted (the encrusting material either colorless crystals or yellow - red brown resinous matter), and 9) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae smooth or encrusted with colorless crystals, clamp connections occurring only rarely on basal hyphae, the subicular hyphae wide, branching at nearly right angles, forming a lattice-work, becoming thick-walled, sometimes encrusted with crystals.^ RANGE ^Phanerochaete sordida has been found in BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, MB, NB, NS, NT, ON, PE, PQ, AK, AL, AZ, CA, CO, DC, FL, GA, IL, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NM, NY, TN, VT, and WI, (Ginns).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'dirty'
SIMILAR  Phanerochaete affinis can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach). P. affinis has cystidia that are more numerous, narrower and more tapering than in P. sordida, (Eriksson). P. affinis 1) has a fibrillose to cordonic margin, 2) is usually more orange than P. sordida, and 3) has a more compact and somewhat less agglutinated subiculum with less rigid-appearing hyphae than P. sordida, (Burdsall). Phanerochaete chrysosporium has longer cystidia than Phanerochaete sordida and they are thin-walled and more or less enclosed, (Eriksson(5)). Phanerochaete tuberculata lacks cystidia (Breitenbach). Phanerochaete velutina does not have the lattice-work appearance of the subiculum, its cystidia are wider, and the fruitbody is typically pale tan to dark burgundy brown rather than typically cream-colored, (Burdsall).

SIMILAR  Phanerochaete affinis can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach). P. affinis has cystidia that are narrower and more tapering than in P. velutina, (Eriksson). P. affinis may be similar macroscopically and like P. velutina has a fibrillose or cordonic margin, but P. affinis 1) is usually orange brown to brownish orange whereas P. velutina is pale tan to brownish red or burgundy (often with a violet tint), 2) has smaller cystidia mostly up to 8 um wide, whereas those of P. velutina are mostly greater than 9 um wide, and 3) only occasionally possesses cordons, (Burdsall). Phanerochaete tuberculata lacks cystidia (Breitenbach). Phanerochaete sordida has a lattice-work appearance in the subiculum, cystidia are narrower, and the fruitbody is typically cream-colored, rather than pale tan to dark burgundy brown, (Burdsall).

SIMILAR  Phlebia radiata has practically the same microstructure, but is radially folded, whereas Phlebia rufa is always merulioid-poroid, (Eriksson). Typical specimens of P. acerina [which we treat here as a synonym] have yellowish brown spore-bearing surfaces that are unchanged in KOH, whereas the spore bearing surfaces of P. rufa are reddish brown and turn even darker in KOH. Fruitbodies of P. rufa are generally thinner and less robust than those of P. acerina. The folds in P. acerina are broader, and the margins are usually entire and often detach whereas those of P. rufa are fibrillose and closely appressed. Mature P. acerina often develops "a differentiated subiculum with conglutinated parallel hyphae next to the substrate and a loose upper layer that contains abundant, yellow, amorphous substances", but this is never present in P. rufa. Hymenial cystidia are usually present in P. acerina and are difficult to separate from agglutinated hymenial elements, whereas hymenial cystidia are rare to absent in P. rufa and hymenial elements are not agglutinated and are therefore easier to separate. The spore-bearing surface may be interrupted in P. acerina by "white, felty to woolly mycelia". (Nakasone(10)). See also SIMILAR section of Phlebia tremellosa.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  The distinctive feature is the bright yellow-orange rhizomorphs which are seen in the litter or humus layers of acid coniferous forests, more commonly than the fruitbodies. Other features include 1) resupinate growth on rotten wood or other substrates, 2) soft, cottony fruitbodies that are generally yellow (but sometimes whitish), and smooth to slightly tuberculate (fine-pored under a 50x lens), 3) spores that are nearly round, smooth, rather thick-walled, non-amyloid, and colorless, and have one droplet, and 4) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae without clamp connections, the basal and rhizomorph hyphae with yellow encrustation.^ | Corticium bicolor Peck may be a different species but the name has been used for this species in the past.

LATIN NAME(S)  Protodontia oligacantha  G.W. Martin^  J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 43: 16. 1953
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  The outstanding features are "the sparse development of the spines and the broad, spineless, fimbriate margin" (Martin). Features include 1) growth on dead wood of black cottonwood, 2) a brown, waxy fruitbody with spines sparsely and irregularly distributed, that fades to buff or pallid near the margin, the margin broad and fringed, without spines, 3) spores that are cylindric to allantoid, usually with numerous small droplets, germinating by repetition, 4) basidia that become cruciate-septate, and 5) dendrophyses.^ | The description is derived from Martin. Roberts(3) says, "Based on the type description and illustrations, this Canadian taxon is clearly unrelated to Protodontia, having an effused brown basidiome with fimbriate margin, non-myxarioid basidia, and comparatively large allantoid spores. It would appear to be referable to the genus Heterochaete" (genus names italicized). RANGE ^Protodontia oligacantha was described from BC. It is known only from the type and three paratype specimens (Ginns).
FRUITING BODY  broadly effused [spread out], up to 1.3cm by 0.5cm in extent, possibly larger, waxy when moist, the spore-bearing surface drying horny; "benzo brown" to "cinnamon drab", fading to buff or pallid near the margin; margin broad, thin, fimbriate [fringed], white (no suggestion that margin is ever determinate); spines sparsely and irregularly distributed, (where most abundant, 3-5 per square millimeter), blunt, broad, somewhat fimbriate, white, up to 0.06cm long and 0.035cm across at base, tapering toward tips
HABITAT  on dead wood of Populus trichocarpa (Black Cottonwood), July 26-August 11
MICROSCOPIC  SPORES (9)10-12(13) x (4)4.5-5(5.5) um, cylindric to allantoid, usually with numerous small droplets, sometimes with 1-3 large droplets and numerous smaller ones, germinating by repetition^; PROBASIDIA spherical to ovate or pyriform, "mostly 13-20 x 9-12 um, becoming cruciate-septate, each cell producing a thick, rather short epibasidium, 2-2.5(3) um in diameter"; DENDROPHYSES "3-4 um in diameter at base, branching subdichotomously several times and irregularly attenuated toward the tips, sometimes with clamp-connections"; spines "fertile over most of the surface, as is the hymenium between them, but the extreme tip is often sterile", "owing to protrusion of an extension of the intermediate yellow layer, giving them a fimbriate appearance when examined dry under a binocular", spines "tend to be borne in lines on whitish strands, which makes the hymenial surface appear faintly reticulate under a lens"; hymenium "composed of colorless basidia and dendrophyses", the latter rather difficult to see since the terminal part does not stain; "in section 65-230 um thick between the spines, composed of a colorless hymenial layer 20-40 um thick, a yellowish basal layer of horizontal hyphae and an intermediate layer of variable thickness, clear yellow by transmitted light, which penetrates the spines, composed of indistinct agglutinated hyphae intermingled with crystalline accretions"

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Scytinostroma protrusum is very similar to Scytinostroma galactinum (Fr.) Donk, except that S. protrusum subsp. protrusum 1) has slightly smaller and narrower spores on average, 2) the amyloid reaction is limited to a small part of the adaxial spore surface (in S. galactinum amyloid or not, amyloid reaction distributed evenly or limited to a small part of the adaxial surface), 3) has slight cultural differences, 4) grows on hardwoods (S. galactinum on conifers and occasionally hardwoods), and 5) is distributed within North America in the southeastern United States (S. galactinum throughout U.S.), (Nakasone). S. protrusum subsp. septentrionale has spore width in the range of S. galactinum, but 1) has slight cultural differences from the other two, 2) grows on hardwoods (rarely on conifer wood), and 3) is distributed within North America in the northern United States, (Nakasone).^ RANGE ^Subsp. protrusum has been found in FL, GA, IL, IN, KY, and MD, and subsp. septentrionale in ID, MI, MN, NY, and WI, (Ginns). Members of the S. galactinum complex do occur in Europe: in particular a collection from France was found to be similar to S. protrusum subsp. septentrionale, (Nakasone).
FRUITING BODY  see Scytinostroma galactinum, which is macroscopically indistinguishable
HABITAT  subspecies protrusum is often associated with a root rot of various hardwoods, especially apple, subspecies septentrionale is found typically on hardwoods such as Acer (maple), Alnus (alder), Betula (birch), and Populus^, (Nakasone)

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Also listed in Jelly category. Sebacina lactescens is characterized by firm-gelatinous fruitbodies, stalked basidia, and conspicuous golden to brownish yellow gloeocystidia, (McNabb). Other features include dingy hyaline, dingy white, or pallid ochraceous fruitbodies that originate as pustules and become smooth or convoluted, coalescing to form irregular areas up to 10cm long, growth on hardwood and conifer bark and wood, spores that are short-cylindric to broadly elliptic and often slightly curved, and dikaryophyses. This is a common species on the west coast (R. Bandoni, pers. comm.): it has usually been known as Ductifera sucina (Moeller) K. Wells.^ | But at least one of Moeller's specimens of Exidia sucina was later found to be the same as Ductifera pululahuana (Pat.) Donk, and the earliest valid name for Ductifera sucina appears to be Sebacina lactescens Burt (K. Wells, pers. comm.). The description is derived from McNabb(10). RANGE ^There are collections of this species (as Ductifera sucina or D. succina) from BC and WA at the University of British Columbia. Worldwide distribution includes CA, NC, NM, Panama, Jamaica, Windward Islands, Brazil, Australia, (Klett(1)), and New Zealand (McNabb(10)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  "Steccherinum laeticolor would appear to be well separated from S. ochraceum by several characters, but not all of them are unrelated and one or two may be found to be either underdeveloped or altered by age. One of the characters probably least subject to change is the aspect of the margin", the margin of the effused part in S. laeticolor is fimbriate, and in S. ochraceum is delicately scalloped and evenly velutinous [velvety], (Maas Geesteranus, Latin names italicized). The type of Hydnum laeticolor is similar to Steccherinum ochraceum but lacks hymenial detail, (Ginns). Steccherinum laeticolor 'is certainly very close to the common Steccherinum ochraceum (Fries) S. F. Gray. Banker (1912) considered H. laeticolor, which he placed in the genus Steccherinum S. F. Gray, to differ ". . . by its soft-spongy or almost cotton-like substance and its pronounced reddish color when young and fresh . . . " Miller and Boyle (1943) state that H. laeticolor differs in having slightly larger spores. None of these characters is discernible in the type material.'

Distribution includes Guatemala, Mexico, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, and China, (Chamuris(4)).
FRUITING BODY  effuso-reflexed, also resupinate on underside of substrate, forming patches several centimeters to decimeters across; caps usually fused in rows and extending 1-1.5cm from the substrate, 0.1-0.2cm thick, consistency elastic and tough (hard and brittle when dry), upper surface appressed-tomentose to bald, rust-brown, "margin crisped, whitish to ocherish, sharp-edged"; spore-bearing surface smooth to tuberculate, gray-brown, red-brown, to ocher-brown, with gray overcast in places, "fresh fruitbodies turning red when injured", margin of spore-bearing area "when growing white, tuberculate, plicate, undulating, distinctly bounded"^, (Breitenbach), effused [spread out on substrate], "resupinate to reflexed orbicular and confluent", tough (rather hard when dried), usually up to 0.1cm thick; cap "dimidiate to broadly attached, lobed", often fused laterally with adjacent caps, up to 2cm wide, tomentose or velvety in narrow zones, gray to pale brown or by age almost rusty brown, "tomentum zonewise disappearing" and exposing a bald dark brown cortex, margin paler than the rest of the cap; spore-bearing surface "smooth to tuberculate, in larger specimens partly folded radially", wood-colored to pale olivaceous or buff, darker by age, "bleeding when cut or touched, fluid distinctly reddish", later discolored in shades of brown; flesh pale ochraceous, up to 0.05cm thick and separated from the tomentum by a 0.0025-0.0075cm thick dark brown zone of compacted hyphae, (Eriksson), spore deposit white (Buczacki)
HABITAT  restricted to Quercus (oak)^, (Chamuris(4)), on dead wood of Quercus with and without bark, on standing and fallen trunks, and attached or fallen branches, often covering entire trunks and branches for meters; according to the literature also occurring rarely on other hardwoods, (Breitenbach), restricted to Quercus in Scandinavia, usually on standing trunks and still attached branches, more rarely on fallen branches and other debris of oak, (Eriksson), reported on 16 species of oak and on a variety of hardwoods, also reported on Pseudotsuga menziesii, (Ginns), all year (Buczacki)

NAME ORIGIN  from 'gausapa', meaning 'shaggy, woolen cloth or garment'
SIMILAR  Stereum gausapatum can be distinguished from members of the Stereum hirsutum complex on the basis of 1) pseudocystidial wall thickness less than 1.5 um (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex have pseudocystidial wall thickness greater than 1.5 um). Other characters that can be helpful are 2) Stereum gausapatum is restricted to Quercus (oak), (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex can grow on oak, but a Stereum specimen on oak is most likely to be S. gausapatum), 3) S. gausapatum usually bleeds or bruises red, while dry hymenia show dark violet or blackish stains instead, (S. complicatum may bruise red, but microscopic examination of radial sections reveal that the conducting hyphae do not possess the brownish contents typical of S. gausapatum - on the other hand S. versicolor, found in Florida and tropical areas, may possess brownish conducting hyphal contents), 4) caps of S. gausapatum are usually radially plicate, 5) the hymenium of S. gausapatum is buff to clay-colored, whereas that of S. hirsutum is yellow to pale orange. (Chamuris(4)). |Stereum rugosum has a harder and thicker fruitbody and microscopically has pseudoacanthohyphidia (Eriksson). |See also SIMILAR section of Stereum ochraceoflavum and Stereum sanguinolentum.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  hairy parchment, false turkey-tail, hairy Stereum, hairy curtain crust
NOTES  {See also Stereum Table.} Care must be taken not to confuse this genus with Trametes (see Polypore category), whose underside will reveal pores when examined with a hand lens. |Features of Stereum hirsutum include 1) growth on hardwood, and occasionally conifer wood, 2) elastic, tough fruitbody that is semicircular to fan-shaped, usually shingled and forming rows, but may be resupinate, or bent outward from resupinate surface to form a shelf, 3) cap surface that is hairy-tomentose, zoned, yellow-orange to reddish brown with grayish white tomentum, with wavy surface and margin, the margin lobed and lighter in color, 4) spore-bearing surface that is grayish to yellowish, ochraceous, pale orange or orange-brown (with a whitish margin in actively growing specimens), not generally turning red when bruised, 5) spores that are narrowly elliptic to cylindric, smooth, weakly amyloid, and colorless, 6) conducting hyphae ending in pseudocystidia, and also sharp-tipped hyphidia present, 7) 2 types of hyphae, neither with clamp connections: thin-walled to thick-walled and branching, and thick-walled, branching less.^ |Stereum complicatum, Stereum gausapatum, Stereum hirsutum, and Stereum ochraceoflavum are members of the subgenus Stereum, having sharp tipped hyphidia but lacking the pseudoacanthohyphidia found in subgenus Aculeatostereum. The Stereum hirsutum complex according to Welden(4) in 1971, referred to in Chamuris(4) in 1985, includes 1) Stereum hirsutum, 2) Stereum complicatum, 3) Stereum gausapatum (excluded by Chamuris(4) on the grounds that it is easily distinguished), 4) Stereum versicolor (Swartz) Fr. (found in Florida and other tropical / subtropical areas), 5) Stereum styracifluum (Schwein.) Fr. reported from Alabama and North Carolina, said to be effused or slightly reflexed and bleed yellow, regarded by Chamuris as a synonym of S. hirsutum, and 6) Stereum subtomentosum Pouzar, reported from Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Quebec, said to be effused-reflexed to stemmed and bleed yellow, regarded by Chamuris as a synonym of S. hirsutum, but suspected by Ginns(5) to be a common species, with specimens being misnamed S. ostrea. |The distinctions are sometimes not easy in practice - Welden(4) in 1971 despaired of differentiating Stereum complicatum and Stereum gausapatum from Stereum hirsutum because they were little different microscopically and morphological features were not dependable. Welden's solution was to synonymize the other five taxa in the complex with Stereum hirsutum. RANGE ^Stereum hirsutum is found in BC, WA, OR, ID, and also AB, NB, NF, NS, NT, ON, PE, PQ, SK, AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IA, IN, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, PA RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA, VT, WI, WV, and WY, (Ginns(5) who recognize the members of the complex as independent species). Stereum hirsutum is common in Scandinavia (Eriksson), and found in Europe including Switzerland, and in Asia, (Breitenbach). It is also found in Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Italy, Malawi, Uganda, and the Philippines, (Chamuris(4)).
FRUITING BODY  capped to semicapped, also resupinate on the underside of the substrate, caps projecting 0.5-3cm, semicircular to fan-shaped, usually coalescent to form rows and imbricate [shingled], "broadly attached and often decurrent, undulating", 0.1-0.2cm thick, consistency elastic, tough; cap surface "hirsute-tomentose, zoned, yellow-orange with gray-whitish tomentum", fading to gray-ocherish and bald when old, margin undulating, inflated and somewhat lighter in color; spore-bearing lower surface "bright yellow-orange to brown-orange, when old gray-brown, does not turn red when injured" (although according to Jahn 1971 fruitbodies can be found that turn red when injured during their active phase of growth), "smooth, slightly tuberculate to even"; in cross-section, "a thin, yellow-orange intermediate layer is distinctly visible between the cortex (tomentum) and trama"^, (Breitenbach) |resupinate, orbicular [circular], effused-reflexed to distinctly capped, tough when fresh, harder when dried, up to 0.2cm thick; cap up to 3cm wide, "dimidiate to broadly attached and often fused laterally to adjacent fruitbodies" or densely imbricate [shingled], often lobed and wavy; at first white, then grayish to unevenly dirty brown; "tomentose-hirsute-hispid, generally zonate", by age the tomentum disappears zonewise and exposes a brown and bald cortex; spore-bearing surface grayish to yellowish or pale orange with a white margin in actively growing specimens, "later more yellow to ochraceous, in dead and hibernating specimens almost buff"; margin distinct on effused part; flesh yellow to ochraceous, up to 0.1cm thick, (Eriksson) |overall color (for S. hirsutum group) variable: orange-brown to reddish brown to cinnamon when moist, but appearing buff to grayish or paler from the hairs when dry, when old sometimes greenish from algae or even blackish, (Arora) |spore deposit white (Buczacki)
HABITAT  often covering entire trunks and branches for meters; on dead wood of hardwoods with and without bark, on standing and fallen trunks, and on attached and fallen branches; throughout the year^, (Breitenbach) |on hardwood but occasionally also on Picea (spruce) and Pinus (pine), (Eriksson) |on many genera of hardwoods, also reported on Abies (fir), Juniperus (juniper), Larix (larch), Libocedrus decurrens (Incense-cedar), Picea (spruce), Pinus (pine), Pseudotsuga (Douglas-fir), and Tsuga (hemlock); associated with a white rot, (Ginns) |all year (Buczacki)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'hairy'
SIMILAR  Stereum complicatum fruitbodies are small and paper-thin (maybe half the thickness of S. hirsutum), and not wooly (strigose hairy) like S. hirsutum, but instead mostly covered in short, silky hairs (with some hairy zones particularly near the attachment point). The fruitbodies are particularly ruffled and crimped, and very mature specimens tend to develop fingerlike projections. Often they have a white margin on the upper surface separated from the rest of the upper surface by a narrow dark zone. When dried, S. hirsutum is about 0.05-0.06cm thick where S. complicatum is 0.02-0.03cm thick, making dried S. hirsutum fruitbodies feel less pliable than dried S. complicatum fruitbodies, (Sarah G. DeLong-Duhon, pers. comm. April 21, 2022, and May 26, 2022). |S. complicatum 1) is cespitose, strongly confluent, and often imbricate (whereas S. hirsutum is single or gregarious, with some confluence), 2) the folding of the cap is radiately complicate, whereas the cap of S. hirsutum is applanate or radially undulate, and 3) has scant or appressed tomentum, so that cap surface is bald or scantily tomentose, shining, and is concentrically zonate with thin, alternating bands of orange and brownish, whereas Stereum hirsutum has thick tomentum, forming a tomentose, hirsute, strigose, or hispid cap surface that is concentrically furrowed, (Chamuris(3)). |Stereum hirsutum and Stereum gausapatum have a rather thick fruitbody (0.05-0.15cm), sometimes more, whereas Stereum complicatum is usually thinner [key lead gives range 0.03-0.05(0.085)cm], (Julich(5)). |Stereum gausapatum can be distinguished from members of the Stereum hirsutum complex on the basis of 1) pseudocystidial wall thickness less than 1.5 um (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex have pseudocystidial wall thickness greater than 1.5 um), other characters that can be helpful are 2) Stereum gausapatum is restricted to Quercus (oak), (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex can grow on oak, but a Stereum specimen on oak is most likely to be S. gausapatum), 3) S. gausapatum usually bleeds or bruises red, while dry hymenia show dark violet or blackish stains instead, 4) caps of S. gausapatum are usually radially plicate, 5) the hymenium of S. gausapatum is buff to clay-colored, whereas that of S. hirsutum is yellow to pale orange, (Chamuris(4)). |Stereum subtomentosum [regarded by Chamuris(4) as a synonym of S. hirsutum, but suspected by Ginns(5) to be a common species with specimens misnamed S. ostrea] is "similar but well distinguished by usually larger and more spathulate fruitbodies with a softer and more adpressed and velutinous tomentum" (in Scandinavia restricted to alder), (Eriksson). |Stereum ostrea differs microscopically from the Stereum hirsutum group [having pseudoacanthohyphidia for instance] "but can usually be told by its slightly larger caps" (1-7cm broad) "that are more prominently zoned (dark reddish and brown) and usually form individual brackets rather than fusing, and buff to cinnamon-buff underside", (Arora). |Hydnoporia tabacina resembles the S. hirsutum group in shape and color, but its tissue blackens in KOH, (Arora). |Stereum versicolor (Swartz) Fr. - found in Florida and other tropical / subtropical areas - has scant or appressed tomentum, so that cap surface is bald or scantily tomentose, shining, and is concentrically zonate with thin, alternating bands of orange and brownish, (Chamuris(3)). |See also SIMILAR section of Stereum ochraceoflavum and Stereum sanguinolentum.

NOTES  {See also Stereum Table.} Features include 1) growth on hardwoods, often growing together to form a row or rows on twigs and small branches, when young sometimes suspended from the midpoint of a circular cap surface, also resupinate on undersides of the wood, 2) a small, somewhat tough, but relatively thin and pliant fruitbody, the upper side finely hairy-tomentose with hairs pointing toward the margin, indistinctly zoned, whitish or grayish to ocher, with a fringed margin, 3) a spore-bearing surface that is ocherish, smooth, and undulating-tuberculate, 4) spores that are cylindric to elliptic, smooth, amyloid, and colorless, 5) acute tipped hyphidia and also pseudocystidia (but not pseudoacanthohyphidia or conducting hyphae), 6) hyphae of 2 types: a) thin-walled to thick-walled, septa without clamp connections, and b) thick-walled.^ |Stereum complicatum, Stereum gausapatum, Stereum hirsutum, and Stereum ochraceoflavum are members of the subgenus Stereum, having sharp tipped hyphidia but lacking the pseudoacanthohyphidia found in subgenus Aculeatostereum. |In Stereum ochraceoflavum, the well-defined cutis present in most Stereum species is lacking, and the tomentum is derived directly from the pale colored context. (This well-defined cutis layer is lacking also in Stereum striatum [found in eastern North America and growing on Carpinus or rarely Nyssa], but the tomentum is more or less appressed in that species, giving a cap surface that appears lineate-striate, shining, and silky).

SIMILAR  Stereum hirsutum always has a bright ocher-orange spore-bearing surface when fresh and substantially thicker fruitbodies; S. ochraceoflavum favors twigs and prunings, while S. hirsutum is also found on trunks, in crevices, and on thick branches, (Breitenbach). S. ochraceoflavum is distinguished from the S. hirsutum group by its duller, paler color and thinner, more pliant cap with long white hairs pointing toward the margin, plus the absence of a red-brown cap cuticle, (Arora). |The Stereum hirsutum complex and S. gausapatum have a compact brown cutis about 50 um thick underlying the tomentum (that is some shade of brown, yellow - gray when old), whereas S. ochraceoflavum lacks the brown cutis and tomentum is whitish, (Chamuris). |Stereum striatum (Fr.) Fr., also lacks a brown cutis layer, but has a tomentum of short appressed hairs (rather than erect hairs), making the cap surface lineate-striate, shining, and silky rather than soft, strigose-hirsute or hispid. S. striatum is restricted to Carpinus (hornbeam), rarely Nyssa (tupelo) whereas S. ochraceoflavum is not known on these substrates. (Chamuris). S. striatum (Fr.) Fr. is known from eastern North America as far west as Texas and reports exist for other hardwood species (Alnus, Betula, Ilex, Liquidambar, Ostrya, Prunus, Quercus, Rhus) according to Ginns(5), but S. ochraceoflavum has been regarded in the past as a variety of S. striatum.

NOTES  Features include 1) resupinate growth on conifer wood and hardwood, less often on other substrates, 2) a white to light brown fruitbody that is thin, easily detached, cobwebby, smooth or minutely granular, the margin fibrillose to rhizomorphic, 3) spores that are nearly round to irregular, with warts, inamyloid, and colorless, 4) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae with clamp connections, frequently inflated near septa, often with needle-like crystals present.^ |The name Grandinia microspora P. Karst. has been applied to at least two fungi. In Liberta(1), Liberta, having seen a lectotype specimen, described the spores as having "irregularly scattered obtuse warts". However, the drawing in Hjortstam(6) seems to have much smaller ornamentation on the spore wall than the warts described by Liberta and may be a second fungus, (Ginns), (note also that rhizomorphs are mentioned in the Hjortstam(6) description but not the Liberta(1) description). RANGE ^Trechispora microspora has been found in BC, ON, PQ, CO, OH, PA, RI, (Ginns).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Tulasnella violea (Quel.)

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) resupinate growth on wood, 2) a waxy fruitbody that is violaceous gray, the margin indistinct, 3) spores measuring 6-7.5 x 3-3.5 um in the type, that are elliptic to oblong, smooth, inamyloid, and colorless, 4) tulasnelloid basidia, and 5) hyphae without clamp connections forming a "conventionally branched" hymenium.^ | Roberts(2) regards this as a species allied to Tulasnella violea and Tulasnella eichleriana with intermediate-sized elliptic spores but notes a problem in that the differentiation from Tulasnella pinicola is only the conventional branching in the hymenium in Tulasnella pruinosa (see MICROSCOPIC) versus the clustered branching of Tulasnella pinicola, a condition not easy to determine in the partly collapsed hymenium of the lectotype used. "For the moment, T. pruinosa is retained as distinct, but it may well prove to be no more than a deceptive form of T. pinicola.", (Roberts, with Latin names italicized). RANGE ^Tulasnella pruinosa has been found in WA, ON, PQ, IA, MT, NC, NH, NY, OH, and WI, (Ginns), and France and the United Kingdom, (Roberts). Some herbarium specimens under this name are Tulasnella eichleriana (due to the arbitrary reinterpretation by Rogers (1933) of T. pruinosa as a small-spored species), (Roberts(2)).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'violet'
SIMILAR  Tulasnella fuscoviolacea is one of a number of species that appear to be morphologically identical to T. violea except for their spores (longer and narrower in T. fuscoviolacea), (Roberts). Tulasnella eichleriana is similar enough that it is listed as a synonym of Tulasnella violea by Martin, but Roberts(2) disagrees strongly because the microscopic dimensions are so different [size of spores for instance]. Tulasnella pruinosa has narrower spores. Tulasnella bifrons has clamp connections according to Roberts(2).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'with short bristles'
SIMILAR  Hyphodontia granulosa has somewhat larger spores, 5-6.5 x 4-5 um, and a different arrangement of spines: as a rule these are +/- far apart in H. granulosa and the smooth hymenium remains clearly visible between them, whereas they are close together in X. breviseta so that the hymenium is almost covered up, (Breitenbach). H. granulosa may be difficult to distinguish, but it is normally separable with the naked eye, as in H. granulosa the surface is smooth with distinct, separate spines, whereas X. breviseta is more furfuraceous; microscopically, differences are small, but the spores of H. granulosa are slightly larger and the texture denser with less distinct hyphae, and the hyphomycete has not been observed in H. granulosa, (Eriksson).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) resupinate growth on hardwood, especially elderberry and other shrubs, less often on conifer wood, 2) a somewhat waxy fruitbody appearing like white paint, smooth or (when vigorously growing) tuberculate, the margin when young thinning out, in the periphery pruinose, when mature more distinct, 3) spores that are elliptic, smooth, inamyloid, and colorless, becoming slightly thick-walled, and then somewhat cyanophilic, 4) cystidial elements that are long-cylindric, often with apical resinous encrustation and attached crystals along the length, with 1-2 clamped septa, and 5) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae with clamp connections, richly branched, with lots of crystals in the texture especially when old.^ | The Breitenbach(2) description is for Lyomyces sambuci (Pers.) Karst.: they give Hyphodontia sambuci (Pers.) Erikss. and Hyphoderma sambuci (Pers.) Jul. as synonyms. |The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 18, 2022, listed the current names a Xylodon sambuci, but MycoBank, accessed the same day, listed the current name as Lyomyces sambuci.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'of Sambucus' (elder, one of its hosts)
SIMILAR  While similar to Hyphodontia species in spore shape, basidia, and cystidioid elements, Xylodon sambuci is different from most Hyphodontia species in 1) the consistency of the fruitbody, which is more ceraceous [waxy], not so fibrous as Hyphodontia, 2) more thin-walled and somewhat wider hyphae, staining only slightly in cotton-blue, and 3) a thickening spore wall that is somewhat cyanophilic, (Eriksson).
