SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores 17-23 x (9)10-16 um, smooth or with small puncta, 2 or sometimes 1 droplet (sometimes indistinct), deBary bubbles sometimes present, thick-walled, episporium highly cyanophilic^; asci 250-325 x 15-20 um, J+ or J-, sometimes golden in Melzer's; paraphyses extending beyond the ascus, expanded at tip to 7-15 um, apically pigmented with small dark highly cyanophilic granules, (Pfister), 19-21 x 12-13 um, broadly elliptic, smooth, colorless, containing 2 large oil droplets, in granular cytoplasm; asci up to 390 x 20 um; paraphyses "slender, simple, apex clavate, up to 8 um thick, brown", (Dennis), 21-22 x 13 um, elliptic, smooth, colorless, with two droplets, thick-walled, protoplasm granular; asci 8-spored, 300 x 17-19 um, weakly amyloid; paraphyses "slender, tips with slight clavate thickenings with brownish contents"; excipulum of rounded cells 50-60 um across in exterior part, medulla a very loose textura intricata, (Breitenbach)
NAME ORIGIN  named for Mr. Babington, collector of type
SIMILAR  Pachyella adnata is up to 5cm across, flat, sometimes becoming convoluted, appressed to the substrate, when old sometimes becoming shallow cup-shaped, colored umber to sepia, black when dried; it has spores 18-20 x 10-12(14) um, that are elliptic, distinctly verrucose (with long blunt warts exceeding 1 um long), thin-walled, colorless, and with 1-2 oil droplets. Psilopezia nummularia was reported from WA and ID in Larsen(1) but not confirmed by either author. P. nummularia is barely distinguishable macroscopically, but has a negative iodine reaction in the asci and the excipulum has an exterior of radial, slender, interwoven hyphae and a medulla of textura intricata, (as opposed to A. babingtonii with rounded cells in exterior part, and the medulla a very loose textura intricata), (Breitenbach). Pachyella clypeata "is macroscopically nearly identical" to P. adnata - compared with A. babingtonii it has a larger (0.5-4cm) "reddish brown fruitbody, later tinted olive then greenish-black and without luster" but has smooth spores with 1-2 oil droplets that measure 25-35 x 12-14 um (Beug). It is included in Coulter(2) but presence in the Pacific Northwest needs to be established with herbarium specimens.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include minute, translucent-white cups on fern stems, hairs on margin and exterior, absent or inconspicuous stem, and microscopic characters including small rod-like spores and lanceolate paraphyses.^ | Dennis(3) described Dasyscypha washingtonensis from part of the type collection of Hyalopeziza pteridis Kanouse Mycologia 39: 660. 1947 (= Lachnella pteridicola Seaver) - he emphasized the broadly lanceolate (not filiform) paraphyses which would not be consistent with Hyalopeziza, but he did not exclude the remote possibility of a mixed collection. Albotricha washingtonensis is not to be confused with Lachnella pteridis Phill., the name that forced the change of epithet to pteridicola when Seaver moved the species from Hyalopeziza to Lachnella. According to Haines(1), this is a common species in the spring in western Washington, "but it is easily overlooked due to its small size. It is only known from the fern Pteridium aquilinum.".

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Atropellis piniphila is most easily differentiated from Atropellis pinicola by its spores. Features include growth on cankers of Ponderosa and lodgepole pine, the fruitbody first closed and rounded to ellipsoid, then expanding, 0.2-0.3cm across, brown to black, with leathery-membranaceous texture and a stem-like base, and microscopic characters, (Weir 1921).^ | It attacks Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta between the ages of 5 and 25 years, the infection occurring usually at the nodes, less frequently on the internodes (but may spread throughout the length of the stem), and causes cankers on the surface. After further examination of Atropellis piniphila (Weir) M.L. Lohman & E.K. Cash and the type of Atropellis arizonica M.L. Lohman & E.K. Cash, the only feature that appeared to differ was the septation of the spores (0-1-septate for the former and 0-3-septate for the latter, not considered enough to define a new species in view of the small number of 3-septate spores examined), (Reid, J.). RANGE ^Collections of A. piniphila were examined from WA, ID, AB, MT, NM, and (the only collection corresponding to A. arizonica) AZ, (Reid, J.(2)).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  lemon-drops
NOTES  Bisporella sulfurina is a minute, yellow, shallow cup with almost no stem, that grows on hardwood logs in association with pyrenomycetes which are often small, round, crust-like, and black. It can be minutely downy on the exterior but is otherwise bald. It tends to be tightly clustered, unlike Bisporella citrina which is not particularly associated with pyrenomycetes. But some authors regard the two species as synonyms.^ | The online Species Fungorum, accessed September 12, 2022, listed the current name as Calycina claroflava (Grev.) Kuntze, but MycoBank, accessed on the same date, listed the current name as Bisporella sulfurina (Quel.) S.E. Carp. |The original basionym was spelled 'sulphurina'.

B. citrina forms slightly larger fruitbodies (0.1-0.3cm) "that grow gregarious but not clustered, is not associated with pyrenomycete crusts, and has slightly broader spores" 3-3.5 um wide, (Desjardin(6)). B. citrina is differentiated by its larger spores (9-14 x 3-5um) and growth on wood without a nearby Pyrenomycete, (Siegel).|Yellow species of Hymenoscyphus are distinctly stalked (Breitenbach(1)). There are many other yellow disc fungi that are difficult to identify.

B. seaveri has fruitbodies formed on mycelial tufts, subiculum scanty or lacking, on sandy soil often associated with burned plant debris, spores 29-36 x 8-10 um, paraphyses sometimes interwoven to form a thin epithecium, (Pfister). Oluna and Adolf Ceska reported B. fusispora from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with spore size (20)23-25 x 8-9(10) um. According to Pfister(3), "Rifai (1968) largely discounted the use of ascospore size differences to distinguish species. He examined primarily type collections and proposed a broad species concept recognizing a single species Inermisia fusispora (Berk.) Rifai with a wide ascospore size range." .

NOTES  Features include 1) large cabbage-like clumps of cups, the clumps becoming almost spherical or elongated and up to 25cm high, or up to 120cm wide, extensively convoluted like a Gyromitra and the cups distorted by mutual pressure, 2) a spore-bearing surface whitish flushed with pink, lilac, or pale ochraceous, 3) brittle flesh, 4) absent to short, thick stem, 5) growth on the ground or on stumps, often in burnt places, and 6) microscopic characters. This species has been known as Peziza proteana var. sparassoides.^ |Seaver described it fungus as Daleomyces phillipsii (Massee) Seaver. He also described Peziza proteana (Boud.) Seaver forma proteana. The two are similar microscopically but Peziza proteana forma proteana lacks the very convoluted form, taking the form of a similarly colored cup or disc 2-6cm across. According to Korf(8) and Dennis(1) these two agree in microscopic characters and those authors as well as others regarded Daleomyces phillipsii (Massee) Seaver as a variety sparassoides or a form sparassoides of Peziza proteana. Korf(8) pointed out that three different authors reported seeing the two forms growing together. |But in 2020, Vizzini(11) concluded from DNA sequencing that Peziza proteana var. proteana was a synonym of Peziza petersii, and Peziza proteana forma sparassoides is a different species which should be called Peziza campbellii. [It may be that that single cups accompanying the sparassoid forms are related to those forms rather than to Peziza petersii (=P. proteana).] | Also in 2020, Van Vooren(2) provided a rationale for the breakup of Peziza into several genera. This process, discussed in more detail under Peziza praetervisa, results in resurrection of Daleomyces phillipsii as the current name of Peziza campbellii. |Both Vizzini(11) and Van Vooren(2) regard Peziza proteana forma proteana (here Daleomyces petersii) as a separate species from Peziza proteana forma sparassoides (here Daleomyces phillipsii). Peziza petersii (here Daleomyces petersii) from Oregon was included in the Vizzini(1) study, confirming the presence of its synonym Peziza proteana forma proteana. The typical form of Peziza proteana is otherwise not well documented from the Pacific Northwest, partly because the form is often not specified (e.g. Larsen(1) lists Washington Oregon, and California for Peziza proteana; the University of Washington online has two Washington collections not specifying the form; Oregon State University online has two Oregon collections not specifying the form [one is Peziza campbellii (here Daleomyces phillipsii), see below]). Even if the herbarium collections were examined and found to be simple cups, it would not be straightforward to confirm the diagnosis. Seaver lists Peziza proteana from New York, Texas, and France, (Seaver(1)). |Seaver describes the sparassoid form as Durandiomyces phillipsii initially and then in the supplement as Daleomyces phillipsii, listing New York, Washington, Oregon, and Europe as the distribution. RANGE ^The attached photos by Laurel Saville and Fred Rhoades are from the same WA collection. Daleomyces phillipsii has been found from NY to WA and OR and Europe, (Seaver(1)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Lachnum virgineum is similar or the same species as Dasyscyphella nivea: Seaver gives Lachnum niveum Karst. as a synonym of Lachnella virginea (Batsch) Phill. saying that none of the characters used to differentiate the two species appear to have any particular value (Phillips in British Discomycetes uses lanceolate paraphyses in L. virgineum, Rehm says they both have lanceolate paraphyses and uses other criteria, Gillet uses the form of the cup or length of hairs). However, the differentiation is maintained by such modern authors as Hansen, L.(1), Dennis(1), and Breitenbach(1) as follows. Lachnum virgineum has hairs that are granulose at the apex, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has the apical 1-3 cells(s) of hairs smooth, also paraphyses of Lachnum virgineum are lanceolate, whereas those of Dasyscyphella nivea are cylindric to narrowly lanceolate, (Hansen). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses considerably longer than the asci, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, scarcely longer than the asci, as well as a different type of hairs on exterior, (Dennis). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses, hairs with blunt to slightly clavate tips, and grows on dead branches and twigs, Rubus canes, beechnut shells, cones, etc. but Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, hairs with slightly clavate and smooth tips, sometimes with the remains of an exudate, and grows primarily on wood, mostly oak, (Breitenbach). Kanouse records both species from WA without making clear what criteria she used to separate them: her collection of Lachnum niveum on Rubus species has lanceolate paraphyses, (Kanouse), characters that fit the modern concept of Lachnum virgineum better than Dasyscyphella nivea: the presence of Dasyscyphella nivea in the Pacific Northwest remains a subject of inquiry. Dasyscyphus montana Raitv. was collected from BC by O. Ceska, originally identified as D. nivea, but re-identified by her as D. montana. However, spores were measured at 8-11 x 2.5-3 um, narrower than the measurements given in Raitviir(2): (5.0)7.17.8(9.0)  1.82.2 um.

SIMILAR  Lachnellula fuscosanguinea (Rehm) Dennis (=Dasyscyphus fuscosanguineus Rehm) is similar, and D. pini was recombined by Dennis as Lachnellula pini. There is debate about whether the two are one species and whether L. fuscosanguinea occurs in North America. Desjardin(6) reported the latter from California but it is not known whether they distinguish Dasyscyphus pini. They were maintained separately in the online Species Fungorum, accessed June 14, 2016. Hahn(1) regard Dasyscyphus fuscosanguineus as a saprophytic fungus occurring on pine in highlands of central Europe and say that whether it occurs in North America is problematic. According to W.W. Diehl, D. pini differs from D. fuscosanguineus in having definitely branched paraphyses, not thickened at the apex, spores that are often biseptate, and larger asci and spores. (Hahn(1)). Lachnellula arida (W. Phillips) Dennis has smaller spores and asci, and paraphyses with swollen tips, (W.W. Diehl in Hahn(1)).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'with a root'
SIMILAR  D. radicata may be confused with stemmed species of Dacrymyces, but it is readily distinguished microscopically by the difference in the structure of the cap and stem, (McNabb). Dacrymyces capitatus is very similar when immature, because the heterogeneous internal structure of Ditiola radicata does not become evident until late in development: the only sure way of distinguishing these two is to ensure that one has mature fruiting bodies while checking the internal structure, and the septation of the spores: those of Ditiola radicata are tardily 1-(2-)septate, and those of Dacrymyces capitatus are 3-septate with the septa often thickened, (Reid).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Helvella corium is larger, not as tough, and often shows ribs on the stem, (Arora). Plectania milleri differs in having at most a short stem, "cups with a toothed edge and hairier exterior", and slightly smaller spores (21-26 x 9-11 um), (Trudell). Plectania melastoma has at most a short stem, a hairy exterior with reddish orange granules, and spores 20-25 x 8-12 um that are warty, (Trudell). Pseudoplectania melaena has a short or long stem, is slightly larger, and has a yellow-brown cup when young (but blackens when old), (Arora). P. melaena has a shorter stem, an olivaceous brown cup when young, and round spores with an oil drop, (Trudell). Pseudoplectania nigrella lacks a distinct stem and has round spores (Trudell).

This would seem to imply that the mean length <=14.6 um applies also to G. carbonaria which seems doubtful with the spore dimensions given - perhaps it is a matter of punctuation.] Geopyxis delectans, which occurs as close as Colorado, is sessile but broadly instead of narrowly attached to the substrate, it has spore length mostly < 15 um (11.0-12.2-13.9-15.0 x 6.0-7.3-8.3-9.5 um), and habitat is burned ground (Wang, X.-H(1)). G. carbonaria is darker, reddish tan to pale ocher-brown (as opposed to pale orangish buff), and is common [in Sierra Nevada and coastal California] in burnt areas in forests and campfire pits, (MykoWeb, who give habitat of G. deceptiva as bare soil, moss, or duff)

ENGLISH NAME(S)  violet cup
NOTES  This species is part of our Geoscypha violacea group, differing from G. violacea chiefly in its spores. Features include a saucer-shaped to expanded fruitbody with violet upper surface and pale violaceous scurfy lower surface, absent stem, growth on burned places and occasionally elsewhere on the ground, and finely warted mature spores.^ |There have been difficulties interpreting P. violacea Pers. and P. praetervisa Bres.: according to Pfister(5), "Peziza praetervisa has lightly ornamented spores as described by Seaver for P. violacea. The spores of P. violacea are completely smooth. Though P. violacea exists in North America, it is infrequently collected. Most collections under that name are P. praetervisa." The name Peziza praetervisa Bres. in the sense of Dennis has been used for Geoscypha tenacella with finely ornamented spores, as the sense of Bresadola may correspond to Peziza petersii Berk. & Curt. (now Daleomyces petersii). Because of these difficulties the name Peziza subviolacea Svrcek was proposed for P. praetervisa Bres. sensu Dennis. In effect, one view (that of Dennis(1), Pfister(5), Breitenbach(1)) uses the name P. praetervisa Bres. for the commoner species in North America that has finely warted mature spores and P. violacea Pers. for the one with smooth mature spores, and the other uses the name Peziza violacea Pers.: Fr. or Peziza subviolacea Svrcek for the commoner species in North America with finely warted spores and Peziza sublilacina Svrcek for the one with smooth spores. We follow Michael Beug in avoiding the name Peziza violacea which is ambiguous. |The current name of Peziza sublilacina in Species Fungorum was Peziza moseri when accessed on February 14, 2022. |A further development (Van Vooren(2)) is the designation of a 2010 neotype for Peziza violacea Pers., using the current name Geoscypha violacea (Pers.) Lambotte. It is hard to know what this may represent in North America, but DNA will probably solve that question. So far, according to D. Miller, pers. comm. January 8, 2022, collections matching the Geoscypha violacea neotype have been found in Alaska (1) and Oregon(2). Microscopic confirmation of smooth or roughened spores is not available for these collections. |The rationale for the use of the genus Geoscypha is that the group of species containing Peziza violacea Pers. (synonyms including P. lobulata (Velen.) Svrcek and P. pseudoviolacea Donadini) is not closely related to the core group of Peziza (containing Peziza vesiculosa, P. varia, P. oliviae, P. echinospora, and P. arvernensis, etc.). As a result, along with some morphological factors, this violacea-ampelina clade needs a resurrected genus. Besides P. violacea with its neotype, Van Vooren(2) combines Peziza queletii Medardi, Lantieri & Cacialli as Geoscypha ampelina, and Peziza tenacella W. Phillips ex Sacc. (nom. illeg.) as Geoscypha tenacella. In Table 2 on page 182, Van Vooren(2) lists Peziza praetervisa sensu Dennis and Peziza subviolacea Svrcek as older names corresponding to the current name Peziza tenacella W. Phillips (1886), nom. illeg. Later in the paper, he appears to list the last name as a synonym of Geoscypha tenacella, but lists the name as Peziza tenacella W. Phillips, in Cooke, Grevillea, 15: 100 (1887), nom. illeg. with a different date. In the actual Grevillea issue, the date associated with the entry is 1887, but the Grevillea issue is dated 1886-1887, so the date discrepancy can presumably be ignored. |The Peziza core group could still have been defined as including the /violacea-ampelina, /howsei, and /petersii lineages as well as the genera Elderia and Mattirolomyces. But if we accept the Van Vooren(2) use of new and resurrected genera for Peziza, this means that we have a different name for Peziza praetervisa sensu Dennis (and Peziza subviolacea), namely Geoscypha tenacella. (The synonymy was not explicitly made in the paper however.) It also means that Peziza proteana f. proteana is Daleomyces petersii rather than Peziza petersii in the schema of Vizzini(11) and that Peziza proteana f. sparassoides is Daleomyces phillipsii rather than Peziza campbellii in the schema of Vizzini(11). |At present we use the name Geoscypha tenacella for the species with finely warted spores and Geoscypha violacea (or Peziza moseri) for the one with smooth spores. |According to Beug(3), P. praetervisa has lightly ornamented spores with two oil drops and Peziza sublilacina has smooth spores with no oil drops. RANGE ^Peziza praetervisa has been found at least in OR, ID, also AB, CO, (according to Larsen(1) who also list P. violacea for British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho). There are collections under the name Peziza praetervisa Bres. for BC at Pacific Forestry Centre and University of British Columbia. It has been reported from WA by Andrew Parker, pers. comm.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Geoscypha violacea (=Peziza lobulata (Velenovsky) Svrcek, =Peziza violacea Persoon sensu Dennis, =Plicaria adusta Velen.) is closely related to G. tenacella (as Peziza praetervisa) - it has spores 13-15.5 x 7-8.5 um and curved paraphyses (Beug(3)). While Beug(3) says that P. lobulata is not associated with burn sites, Svrcek(1) examined Velenovsky's material of the synonym Plicaria adusta from burnt soil, giving spore size 13-14 x 7-8 um. Hansen, L.(1) says the fruitbodies of P. lobulata are disc-shaped to cup-shaped and 0.5-3cm across, the hymenium violet, the exterior bluish gray and bald, the habitat newly burnt ground, the spores 13-15.5 x 7-8.5 um, smooth without guttules, and the paraphyses curved, with violaceous brown contents. |Malvipezia howsei is a purple cup that has large spores (17-22 x 8-11 um) and is not associated with burn sites (Beug(3)). It is sometimes considered a purple variation of Malvipezia emileia, for which there is some evidence of presence in the Pacific Northwest. |See also SIMILAR section of Peziza domiciliana and Peziza moseri.

SIMILAR  Although Beug(3) gave Peziza violacea sensu Dennis and Peziza lobulata as synonyms, they said that Peziza lobulata is not associated with burn sites. Other authors (e.g. Hansen, L.(1)) do not agree with the habitat difference. |Peziza tenacella (as Peziza praetervisa) has lightly ornamented spores with 2 droplets, while Peziza sublilacina [like Geoscypha violacea] has smooth spores without oil droplets (Beug(3)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Disciotis venosa is more cup-like and more veined, sometimes has a chlorine odor, and has smooth spores without large oil droplets (but sometimes small droplets at ends outside the spore wall). Discina leucoxantha is yellowish, has somewhat different spores, and is found under both hardwoods and conifers, (Arora). D. leucoxantha has a bright yellow brown to orange brown fresh upper surface and the spore apiculi are depressed (concave-truncate, each appearing as if there are two points instead of one), (Abbott). Gyromitra melaleucoides has a somewhat waxy-looking underside when moist, a sometimes slightly longer narrower stem, and much shorter non-apiculate spores, (Arora). Gyromitra olympiana is smaller, with different spores (strongly three-sided, in one view narrow and in another almost diamond-shaped), whereas spores of G. ancilis are narrowly fusoid and have prominent apiculi, (Kanouse(6) discussing Discina olympiana and Discina perlata). Some spores of Gyromitra olympiana have a broad blunt thickening at both ends. Spores of Gyromitra ancilis, Gyromitra olympiana, Gyromitra leucoxantha, and Gyromitra melaleucoides should be mature spores from a spore deposit when comparison is made (Michael Beug, pers. comm.)

NAME ORIGIN  after Olympic National Park, where the type collection was found (Kanouse)
SIMILAR  Gyromitra ancilis is larger and has different spores that are narrowly fusoid and with prominent apiculi, whereas those of G. olympiana strongly three-sided (in one view narrow and in another almost diamond-shaped), (Kanouse, discussing Discina perlata and Discina olympiana). Some spores of Gyromitra ancilis have prominent pointed apiculi at both ends. Some spores of Gyromitra leucoxantha have concave apiculi at maturity. Spores of Gyromitra melaleucoides are smaller and lack apiculi. Spores of Gyromitra ancilis, Gyromitra olympiana, Gyromitra leucoxantha, and Gyromitra melaleucoides should be mature spores from a spore deposit when comparison is made (Michael Beug, pers. comm.).

NOTES  Features include minute, hanging, tall tubular whitish cups, stem absent except as a narrowing to bring fruitbodies on oblique surfaces to a vertical position, growth on dead wood, scattered in small groups or densely crowded in large colonies, and microscopic characters including external dichophytic hairs except at extreme margin, and basidia.^ | Reid's description is for var. americana which he says differs from the type variety only in having clamp connections (while Cooke says basidia of the type are 4-spored, Reid found only 2-spored basidia in the type: if this is true throughout the collection, it may be a consequence of a haploid state and then the absence of clamp connections would be of questionable taxonomic significance), (Reid). RANGE ^Henningsomyces puber is found in BC, ON, CT, and MI, (Ginns), and Sweden, (Cooke).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  ^
UPPER SURFACE  fruitbodies nearly spherical at first, becoming tubular up to 0.08cm long pointing downwards; white when fresh, cream or buff when dried^, (Reid), 0.025-0.05cm in diameter, 0.1-0.2cm tall, like a tall tubular cup, pendant, (Cooke)
FLESH  thin^ (Cooke)
UNDERSIDE  white when fresh, cream or buff when dried; more or less bald to the eye but minutely scurfy-pruinose under hand-lens^, (Reid)
STEM  normally without stem, but some fruitbodies that are obliquely situated may narrow near base into a stem-like base that curves downward so that the fruitbody is brought into position pointing downward; without any obvious trace of a subiculum^ (Reid)

SIMILAR  Donk writes of Lachnella villosa, "The fruit-body is on an average much smaller and more tender than in Lachnella alboviolascens, and closes less perfectly to a globular body. The latter species has a more fleshy disc which almost invariably (at least in not too proliferous fruit-bodies) turns dark. The presence of numerous 'basidioles' [in L. villosa] may be another important difference. Finally, L. villosa prefers herbaceous or only slightly woody substrata, while L. alboviolascens grows almost invariably on woody substrata (though these may be very thin branches).", (Donk(1), with Latin names in italics), L. villosa usually occurs on herbaceous stems and has a whiter spore-bearing surface, slightly smaller spores, and spear-shaped cystidia, (Buczacki), L. villosa has thinner hymenium.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Lachnellula arida is distinguished by its brown exterior and brown hairs, relatively broad spores, and growth on the wood of Abies (true fir) spp. (Trudell & Ammirati, 2009). Other features include small size, cup-shaped to plate-shaped fruitbody with pale to gold-yellow upper surface, and short stem.^ RANGE ^Lachnellula arida was described originally from CA. The distribution is from at least NF to AB and south to CO and CA, as well as Europe (Seaver). It is included for the Pacific Northwest in Trudell(4), and is found in WA and NM (S. Trudell, pers. comm.). Haines(1) reported it for WA in his Masters of Science thesis.

NAME ORIGIN  'arida' means 'dry'
SIMILAR  Lachnellula flavovirens was collected from BC and WA and deposited by O. Ceska at the University of British Columbia. This species and Lachnellula arida are shown on the same page in Breitenbach(1) who give the spore measurements as 10-13 x 3.5-5.5 um for L. flavovirens and say the margin is "thickly set with cinnamon-brown hairs". Lachnellula fuscosanguinea (Rehm) Dennis is illustrated by Desjardin(6) for California. Habitat is bark of dead conifer branches including pine, external hairs are yellowish brown to rusty brown as opposed to dark brown for L. arida, and spores are larger, measuring 13-15 x 4-5 um. (Desjardin(6)). See also Dasyscyphus pini which might be the same species as L. fuscosanguinea. D. pini has larger spores and asci, and paraphyses lack swollen tips, (W.W. Diehl in Hahn(1)). Several Lachnum species also have brown hairs but are generally smaller, often with lanceolate paraphyses. See descriptions for Lachnum cerinum, Lachnum clandestinum, and Lachnum flavofuligineum. According to Haines(1), Brunnipila calyculiformis (=Lachnum calyculiforme, =Dasyscyphus calyculiformis) was reported from WA by Kanouse but Seaver stated that there was some doubt about the determination. There is a D. Stuntz collection from WA at the University of Washington. Haines(1) reported two collections from WA with the reservation that the hairs were longer (up to 200 um) than Dennis's description and there was no color reaction with the hairs in KOH. Haines(1) reported from WA one collection of yet another brown-haired species, Lachnum fuscescens, "easily recognized by its thick-walled hairs, tipped with crystal masses". Haines(1) further reports from WA, a collection of Brunnipila palearum (=Lachnum palearum, =Dasyscyphus palearum) "striking in its appearance" due to the presence on the tips of the brown hairs of yellowish crystal masses which contrast with the brown exterior of the cup and give the cup a frosty appearance. Haines(1) examined a collection of Lachnum barbatum (as Dasyscyphus barbatus, also known as Trichopezizella barbata) from before 1942 by J.W. Hotson on Oplopanax horridus (devil's club). It has large, smooth, dark brown hairs 4-5 um wide, up to 250 um long, some with swollen tips, others with tapering tips. See also Lasiobelonium spp.

SIMILAR  Lachnellula ciliata (G.G. Hahn) Dennis, has larger spores and is said by Haines(1) to be the most common Lachnellula on Douglas-fir. In his Master's thesis that included Lachnellula spp. of western Washington, he does not mention L. pseudotsugae by name though he adds that a similar species has been described which is the cause of cankers of Pseudotsuga "but no material was seen for comparison". Dasyscyphus ellisianus (Rehm) Sacc. is an eastern North American species found to be associated with cankers on Douglas-fir among other species by Hahn(4), but at that time (1934) it was not found west of Texas.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Lachnum pygmaeum has similar hairs but is much larger and almost bald at maturity, and has long-stalked asci, (Haines(1)). |Dasyscyphella nivea (R. Hedw.) Raitv. is similar or the same species as L. virgineum: Seaver gives Lachnum niveum Karst. as a synonym of Lachnella virginea (Batsch) Phill. saying that none of the characters used to differentiate the two species appear to have any particular value (Phillips in British Discomycetes uses lanceolate paraphyses in L. virgineum, Rehm says they both have lanceolate paraphyses and uses other criteria, Gillet uses the form of the cup or length of hairs). However, the differentiation is maintained by such modern authors as Hansen, L.(1), Dennis(1), and Breitenbach(1) as follows. Lachnum virgineum has hairs that are granulose at apex, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has the apical 1-3 cells(s) of hairs smooth, also paraphyses of Lachnum virgineum are lanceolate, whereas those of Dasyscyphella nivea are cylindric to narrowly lanceolate, (Hansen). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses considerably longer than the asci, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, scarcely longer than the asci, as well as a different type of hairs on exterior, (Dennis). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses, hairs with blunt to slightly clavate tips, and grows on dead branches and twigs, Rubus canes, beechnut shells, cones, etc. but Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, hairs with slightly clavate and smooth tips, sometimes with the remains of an exudate, and grows primarily on wood, mostly oak, (Breitenbach). Kanouse records both species from WA without making clear what criteria she used to separate them: her collection of Lachnum niveum on Rubus species has lanceolate paraphyses, (Kanouse), characters that fit the modern concept of Lachnum virgineum better than Dasyscyphella nivea: the presence of Dasyscyphella nivea in the Pacific Northwest remains uncertain. |Lachnum brevipilosum has been identified by O. Ceska and deposited at the University of British Columbia. Haines(1) also examined L. brevipilosum from western Washington. He says it is related to L. virgineum, but differs in its shorter hairs measuring 40-50(70) um long, smaller spores measuring 5 x 3.5-4 um (clavate), and yellower hymenium (drying to light yellow), and does not have the ragged appearance of L. virgineum. |Haines(1) examined 2 collections from Washington State of Dasyscyphus pudicellus (current name Lachnum tenuissimum (Quel.) Korf & W.Y. Zhuang) on grasses. He said the short-stemmed cups were up to 0.5cm across, entirely cream-white "densely covered with short, white glassy-appearing hairs", the spores 7-10 x 1.5-2.0 um, fusiform to naviculate, the broadly lanceolate paraphyses 4-5 um at widest point, exceeding asci by up to 25 um, hairs 35-65 x 2.5-3.0 um, conspicuously swollen at tip to 4.5-5.0 um, finely granulate for their full length. |Haines(1) also reported a collection of Lachnum roridum (as Dasyscyphus roridus), on thimbleberry stems, "made distinctive by large crystal formations on the tips of its hairs, and by the large size of its paraphyses". He says the short-stemmed cups are up to 0.07cm across, cream-colored on disc and exterior, the exterior densely covered by white-appearing hairs, the spores 6-8(1) x 1.5-2.0 um, narrowly fusiform, the broadly lanceolate paraphyses 4-6 um wide at widest point, 70-100 um long, exceeding asci by up to 50 um, and colorless, the hairs 50-70 x 4.5-5.0 um, usually capped by crystal masses up to 7 um across, cylindric, "sometimes with very slightly enlarged tips", colorless, "thin-walled, finely but conspicuously roughened", 1 or 2 septate. |See also Psilachnum inquilinum on Equisetum under Roseodiscus subcarneus.

SIMILAR  Phylloscypha phyllogena (as P. badio-confusa Korf) was distinguished from L. badia in 1954 by Korf: speaking of P. badio-confusa Korf, he said, "This species is almost invariably determined in America as Peziza badia [name in italics], and certainly is that figured by Seaver... under this name. It is perhaps our commonest large cup-fungus, and it seems to me that it must have been described before 1897 by some European or American author, but I have seen no types which match it. The true P. badia [name in italics] has reticulate spore-markings, as shown by Le Gal". (Korf(5)). |Elliott & Kaufert in 1974 redescribed both of these species microscopically, refining the distinction between the two species: Phylloscypha phyllogena [as Peziza phyllogena] had spores with "walls finely roughened, with warts about 0.5 um in height, frequently smooth at ends of mature spores as primary wall remains attached (apiculus)" (with the letter mu used for um), whereas P. badia had spores "ornamented with short predominantly longitudinal ridges which unite to form an incomplete and irregular reticulum, ridges about 0.5 um in height, apiculus not seen"; if the fruitbody was found on downed wood rather than on the ground it was much more likely to be P. phyllogena although occasional collections of P. badia are found on wood, P. phyllogena was collected from May 18 to July 26 in Canada and from March 28 to June 25 in the US (excluding AK), [although Ginns examined a September 12 collection from ON and cites a September collection from AK], whereas P. badia was collected from July 18 to October 25 in Canada and from June 21 to October 5 in the US; P. phyllogena was examined from BC, ON, PQ, AK, MA, NY, MD, and PA. (Elliott, M.E.(2)). P. phyllogena was reported from BC, WA, OR, ID, CA, UT, (Larsen as P. badioconfusa). |See also SIMILAR section of Legaliana limnaea.

LATIN NAME(S)  Monilinia oxycocci  (Woronin) Honey^  Am. Jour. Bot. 23: 105. 1936;  Sclerotinia oxycocci  Woronin
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Monilinia oxycocci produces a reddish brown cup, disc, or reflexed cup, with a long thin stem, on overwintered mummified cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon).^ | Ascospores infect cranberry shoots and about 3-4 weeks later conidia start to form on the shoots. The conidia disperse, grow to penetrate the ovaries of the flowers, and thereby infect the berries. Young infected cranberry shoots show "tip blight" symptoms: "shriveled shoot tips resemble a shepherd's crook and a tan discoloration spreads from the tip of the shoot down the stem and into leaves"; "To distinguish cottonball tip blight from other shoot diebacks, check the leaves for tan V-shaped or U-shaped lesions centered on the leaf midvein"; "Another indicator is the presence of masses of white, powdery spores (conidia) that appear on diseased shoots just before and during bloom"; "Cottonball tip blight is often inconspicuous and can easily be overlooked"; "Immature diseased berries show no external symptoms, but are filled with the white, cotton-like fungus"; "Healthy berries turn red as they mature; diseased berries may acquire a red blush but are generally yellowish with tan stripes or blotches". (McManus). The distribution is "where the cranberry is cultivated" (Seaver). McManus(1) writes that cottonball, a disease caused by this fungus, fills berries with a cotton-like fungus that makes them unmarketable. It is an economically important disease on many cranberry marshes in Wisconsin. Typically, 2 to 10% of the fruit in diseased beds is infected; if left unchecked the amount can exceed 40%. Cottonball also occurs in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern Canada but losses in those areas have generally been minor. RANGE ^The online Pacific Northwest Plant Disease Management Handbook, accessed December 22, 2013, says that this disease was a problem in WA during the 1920s and 1930s but is rarely found now, except in BC where it is still considered an economic problem. Monilinia oxycocci also occurs in Europe including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland (Hansen), as well as WI as mentioned above (McManus).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Monilinia urnula produces shallowly cup-shaped to flat, dark brown fruiting bodies on fallen mummified Vaccinium berries in spring and early summer. It causes mummyberry disease of blueberries (along with Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi) which became serious in the Puget Sound area of Washington in the early 1960s and was soon present up and down the coast wherever blueberries were grown. The fungus causes a blossom blast [destruction of blossom buds] in addition to blight of young twigs and leaves, the fruit becoming a mummy that falls to the ground and creates new infections the following spring.^ |Note the difference in the width of the fruitbody given by Dennis(1) and by Hansen, L.(1).

LATIN NAME(S)  Myriosclerotinia duriaeana  (Tul. & C. Tul.) N.F. Buchw.^  Friesia 3: 299. 1947;  Sclerotinia duriaeana  (Tul. and C. Tul.) Rehm.;  Hymenoscypha duriaeana  W. Phillips
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Myriosclerotinia duriaeana produces a fawn-brown cup with a short stem, growing one to several from a black spindle-shaped sclerotium that arises on Carex culms.^ | It should not be confused with Mycocalia duriaeana (Tul. & C. Tul.) J.T. Palmer which is a basidiomycete in Nidulariaceae. Myriosclerotinia duriaeana was recorded in Oregon and New York, (Seaver, who, however says that spores are often inequilateral, making the differentiation from Myriosclerotinia sulculata uncertain - see SIMILAR section). RANGE ^Myriosclerotinia duriaeana is recorded as distinct from M. sulculata in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, (Hansen), and MB, Northwest Territories, Greenland, France, and the United Kingdom, (Schumacher).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  ^
UPPER SURFACE  0.3-0.7cm, cup-shaped, light brown to medium brown, (Hansen), reaching 0.2-1cm, "deep cupshaped when young, expanding when mature"; fawn-colored, (Seaver), 0.3-0.6(1.0)cm across, cup-shaped, at maturity with a wavy margin; light cinnamon to umber brown, (Schumacher)
FLESH  
UNDERSIDE  
STEM  0.2-2.5cm x 0.05-0.15cm, arising from sclerotium that is 0.5-1.8cm x 0.1-0.3cm, cylindric, (Hansen), stem 0.5-2cm long, black sclerotium resembling sclerotium of Claviceps, 1-3 in each culm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), often inequilateral, or slightly curved in large specimens, reaching 2-2.5cm x 0.3-0.4cm but often smaller, (Seaver), tapering to form a stem 0.2-2.0cm x 0.05-0.12cm; sclerotium 0.5-1.5cm x 0.1-0.25cm, "slenderly lanceolate to fusiform, straight or slightly curved, subeven to striate, with black outer rind and white to rose inner context", (Schumacher)

EDIBILITY  
HABITAT  1-3 fruitbodies arising from sclerotium, on Carex, "Sporodochial locules in groups of 3-6 distributed at regular intervals along the host culm, each group dull black, elongate, 1-3mm long", (Hansen), on Carex, sclerotia "one to three in each culm, when mature exposed by the rupture of the epidermis along one or two faces of the culm which thus weakened soon breaks over widening the slit and allowing the sclerotia to fall", (Seaver), one to several from sclerotium in culm of Carex and Eriophorum spp. (Schumacher)
SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores 10.5-14 x 5.5-7 um, navicular, flattened to incurved on one side^; asci 130-165 x 7-10 um, (Hansen with illustration of spores), spores 8-18 x 5-9 um, long-ovoid, often inequilateral; asci 8-spored, uniseriate, reaching 150-180 x 7-11 um, slightly narrowed in lower part; paraphyses slender, slightly swollen at top, (Seaver), spores 10.4-18.6 x 5.4-7.2 um (mean 12.3 x 6.4 um), broadly elliptic, flattened to incurved on one side (cymbiform), colorless, without droplets, binucleate or tetranucleate, 1-seriate; asci cylindric, 8-spored, 130-175 x 7-11 um, pore channel wall moderately J+ without pretreatment in 2% KOH; paraphyses filiform, colorless, 2.0-2.5 um wide, "simple, septate", tips slightly inflated to 3.5 um wide
NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Myriosclerotinia sulcatula T. Schumach. & L.M. Kohn (= Sclerotinia sulcata Whetzel) has been documented from NY (holotype) and Europe. Ascospores in M. sulcatula, though similar in size measuring 11.1-17.1 x 5.3-7.5 um, are regularly elliptic to slightly inequilateral, whereas in M. duriaeana they are strongly inequilateral to cymbiform [boat-shaped]. The asci of M. sulcatula are consistently longer (150-210 um) than those of M. duriaeana (130-175 um). The locules of the microconidial anamorph are irregularly scattered on the culm in M. sulcatula, but they are uniformly in pairs at more or less regular intervals along the culm in M. duriaeana. The dimensions of the sclerotium are similar measuring 0.3-2.5cm x 0.15-0.4cm, (Schumacher). Myriosclerotinia caricis-ampullaceae, which also grows on Carex, has sclerotia measuring 3-17 x 0.6-1.5cm. The cups are up to 3cm across and the stems are longer.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Key diagnostic features are the brownish to amber colored, cushion-shaped fruitbodies, erumpent whitish conidial stage, large granular conidia, and growth on Populus.^ | It may cause serious canker formation in native and exotic poplars, especially hybrids and young nursery stock. Cankered areas "first appear slightly more sunken than surrounding tissue, and bark may be discolored orange", acervuli then develop "in concentric waves around the points of inoculation, usually around a lenticel", (Callan). Some authorities regard this as a Pezicula species: Seaver transferred it to Pezicula, and according to Dictionary of the Fungi 10th Edition, molecular data do not support separation of Neofabraea from Pezicula. RANGE ^At the time of Seaver's description, it was known only from the type locality in ON (Seaver), but it is now known more widely, including BC, Europe, and Japan (Callan).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  ^
UPPER SURFACE  apothecia (fruitbody) 0.05-0.2cm across, disc-shaped to cushion-shaped, fleshy; pale brown to amber; acervuli 0.05-0.15cm across and up to 0.005cm thick, "they first appear as pimple-like protrusions before they rupture the epidermis to expose their whitish to yellowish surface"^, (Callan), scarcely exceeding 0.05cm across, erumpent [emerging from the bark] but scarcely rising above the surface, surrounded with the upturned edges of the ruptured outer bark; dark brownish black; spore-bearing surface concave or nearly flat, reddish brown with a slightly elevated darker center that gives the spore-bearing surface an umbilicate appearance, (Seaver)

Glassy processes are also seen microscopically.^ |"Based on the associated dwayaangam-like anamorph [Dwayaangam is a genus in Orbiliaceae] and the deep orange apothecia, the angiosperm-inhabiting Orbilia angiosubvinosa is undoubtedly closely related to the conifericolous O. subvinosa. Our preliminary molecular data indicate a close but distant relationship to that species. Morphologically, O. angiosubvinosa differs in slightly narrower conidia;" (Baral(3) with Latin italicized). |The description is derived from Baral(3). RANGE ^A collection from WA (14 km S of Acme) was used in the Baral(3) monograph. The holotype and other collection are from Spain.

SIMILAR  Orbilia subtrapeziformis is very similar, likewise subalpine-boreal but mainly European and mainly differing in having 8-spored asci. Orbilia maeandrina sharply differs in wider, also slightly shorter, more amygdaliform ascospores (with a markedly lower length/width ratio). Orbilia macrodelphinus is tentatively segregated from O. delphinus based on wider asci and spores.

LATIN NAME(S)  Orbilia species^
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Orbilia species have tiny fruitbodies that are typically brightly colored or white, thin, waxy in consistency, and smooth, often appearing translucent/glassy. They have little or no stem and grow on wood, herbaceous stems, or old pyrenomycetes. Microscopically, they are characterized by relatively small spores, and paraphyses that are abruptly swollen at the tips. They usually have spore bodies in the spores, only found in the Class Orbiliomycetes. Orbilia species occur in the Pacific Northwest but are sparsely documented. Baral(3) is a landmark worldwide monograph published in 2020 that sets a new standard. It contains hundreds of species with only a few documented from the Pacific Northwest. Many more species likely occur here. Identification to species needs to be done by experts with access to the monograph and centers on microscopic characters.^ ||Baral(3) lists the following species from BC: |Orbilia brettii (holotype), |Orbilia xanthostigma, |Orbilia canadensis, |Orbilia flavida, |Orbilia flexisoma, |Orbilia ovalis, |Orbilia spathulata, |Orbilia subtrapeziformis, and |Orbilia vibrioides. |The University of British Columbia has collections from BC labeled Orbilia coccinella by R. Bandoni (1959) and J. Reeve (1960), but that species is now known to be limited to Norway. O. Ceska has deposited at UBC collections labeled Orbilia luteorubella, Orbilia leucostigma, Orbilia sarraziniana, Orbilia xanthostigma, Orbilia delicatula (synonym of Orbilia xanthostigma), and Orbilia inflatula (later combined as Hyalorbilia inflatula). Also at UBC are a collection labeled as Orbilia auricolor by S. Redhead (1971), and a collection labeled as Orbilia luteorubella by Kent Brothers (2010). The UBC collections would benefit from comparison with the Baral(3) monograph. ||Baral(3) lists the following species from WA: |Orbilia angiosubvinosa. |Orbilia flavida ||Baral(3) lists the following species from ID: |Orbilia idahoensis (including holotype), |Orbilia coniferarum, |Orbilia delphinus, |Orbilia macrodelphinus, and |Orbilia maeandrina. ||Orbilia eucalypti was described from CA, but other names have been misapplied to the orange (usually) to rose-lilaceous or even whitish species: Orbilia coccinella, Orbilia luteorubella, and Orbilia xanthostigma, (Baral(3)). O. eucalypti is a widespread species that has been collected often in Europe but only a few collections are listed from North America and none from the Pacific Northwest. Orbilia cruenta was described from PA but the type could not be located for Baral(3) who treat is as a nomen dubium.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) size less than 0.5cm, 2) slightly convex to flat or convex fruitbody that is pale to bright yellow-orange or yellow to honey yellow, 3) gregarious growth on rotten wood or moist ground, and 4) microscopic characters including small cashew-shaped, semicircular spores containing a single round spore body at one end, and at high power, warts on the dorsal side.^ |The description of Orbilia xanthostigma is given in the world Orbiliomycetes monograph (Baral(3)) as a combined description of Orbilia xanthostigma and Orbilia leucostigma. At one time some authors had regarded them as colour forms of the same species. While genetic study has demonstrated that the two are close but separate species, they are separated morphologically by colour: Orbilia xanthostigma is some shade of yellow or yellow-orange when fresh and Orbilia leucostigma is colorless to watery white or pale rose-lilac when fresh (it has no yellow color pigment). The color tends to fade "with the decades" in the herbarium. The color range can extend to a color that Baral(3) call chlorinaceous. |Species of the xanthostigma-leucostigma complex "are readily recognized under the microscope (oil immersion) by small, cashew-shaped, semicircular" ascospores of about 2.53 um length (in situ), "with distinct warts on the rounded dorsal side" and a single globose spore body at one of the two ends. "However, this species complex varies in apothecial colour between whitish to pale chlorinaceous or pale rosaceous-lilaceous and pale to bright yellow(-orange)." |The combined description below is derived from Baral(3). RANGE ^Orbilia xanthostigma collected in BC by O. Ceska (UBC F26068) and this collection was listed in the Baral(3) monograph as documentation seen. Collections were listed of one or the other species from MA, MD, ME, NJ, NY, and PA. Both species are common in Europe, O. xanthostigma more so than O. leucostigma, and collections of O. xanthostigma were also listed by Baral(3) from Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, West Indies, and other oceanic islands.

SIMILAR  Orbilia xanthoflexa from eastern North America, which genetically falls in the leucostigma-xanthostigma clade, and O. renispora from eastern North America, which appears to be related to it but also to O. tremulae (Eurasia), are excluded from the xanthostigma-leucostigma complex because of larger, often less curved ascospores which are consistently completely smooth. (Baral(3) with Latin names italicized). |Other taxa related to the xanthostigma-leucostigma complex but with completely smooth spores are Orbilia fabacearum from Europe, Orbilia subfabacearum from Australia, and Orbilia coccinella (in the sense of the lectotype known only from Norway). "Their spores are partly larger and more variable in shape, with a tendency of some spores to be less curved". Additionally, in O. fabacearum the spore bodies "are inserted at the dorsal side of the spores, and the paraphyses are apically only slightly inflated. O. subfabacearum differs in sometimes having glassy caps on the marginal excipular cells and in a distinct exudate over the paraphyses, also in a tendency of the spores to be curved" by over 180 degrees. "Also O. coccinella has small glassy processes at the margin but deviates from all mentioned species in 16-spored asci.".(Baral(3). with Latin italicized, who do not include any collections of these species from the Pacific Northwest).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  brown clustered ear cup
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Features include a lopsided cup-shaped fruitbody with a shorter side that is split lengthwise, an interior spore surface colored tan to grayish brown or yellowish brown, a similarly colored exterior that is often slightly scurfy, brittle yellowish flesh, a short stem-like base (usually present), growth on the ground in woods often along roadsides, and microscopic characters.^ |Kanouse describes a variety microspora with paler and more yellow color and smaller spores (9-10 x 5.5-6.5 um) from Washington and California: it was later raised to species status as Otidea microspora (but see SIMILAR section). |She lists var. typica from WA and CA also. |Olariaga(1) consider Otidea alutacea sensu lato to comprise a species complex. We are using the term Otidea alutacea group to represent this Otidea alutacea complex. Their molecular study resolved several clades. "It appears that the spore sizes within each clade have a fairly narrow range, but overlap exists between the clades. Patterns of continental speciation are suggested as well; two clades have North American specimens (clades 2, 4), and the rest contain samples from Europe and Asia" (Otidea alutacea sensu stricto and clades 1, 3a, and 3b). The two North American clades, with non-overlapping spore lengths, correspond to the two species distinguished by Peterson, E.T.(1) as O. alutacea (clade 2) and O. umbrina (clade 4). "Clades 2 and 4 have spores that overlap with European clades, and it is so far problematic to distinguish them using only morphology and disregarding the geographical origin." |E.T. Peterson(1) distinguished the two on the basis of the color of the hymenium in dried specimens: for the long-spored taxon "tawny olive", "sayal brown", or "raw umber", and for the short-spored taxon "pale horn color", "drab-gray", lighter than "chamois" or "tawny olive". Peterson further distinguished the two by saying that in the long-spored taxon the exterior lost color slowly on drying whereas in the short-spored taxon the exterior lost color quickly on drying. Peterson also says (italicizing the Latin names), "O. alutacea tends to be lighter in color and more brittle than O. umbrina and has slightly larger spores", but does not specify whether this refers to fresh or dried specimens. |The Otidea alutacea complex needs more research before names can be assigned to different species. |Olariaga(1) give a detailed description of Otidea alutacea sensu stricto in Europe. The descriptions of Breitenbach(1), Dennis(1), and Hansen, L.(1) would also be describing European members of the group. RANGE ^Collections in the different clades were examined by Olariaga(1) from WA (4 collections), OR (1 collection) (clade 2), OR (10 collections) (clade 4), Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Sweden (O. alutacea s. str.), Denmark and Sweden (clade 1), Norway and Sweden (clade 3a), and Denmark and Sweden (clade 3b).

Smith 9351 has far larger spores than stated in the protologue (13-15.5 x 7-8 um versus 9-10 x 5.5-6.5 um) - there are indications that it belongs to the O. alutacea complex.

Smith 30502) differs by only 1 base pair from the ITS sequence of the holotype of O. rainierensis. Olariaga(1) as a result treat the name Otidea microspora as doubtful for the time being. See also SIMILAR section of Otidea leporina.

LATIN NAME(S)  Otidea concinna  (Pers.) Sacc.^  Syll. 8: 96. 1889
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} We follow the Olariaga concept of the species which has not been documented to occur in North America. Features include a lemon yellow lop-sided cup that is slit laterally and somewhat inrolled, an inner spore-bearing surface sometimes with reddish tinges, an absent to short stem lighter than the rest of the fruitbody, and microscopic characters.^ | Otidea concinna (Pers.) Sacc. was listed in the online Species Fungorum, accessed May 7, 2015, as a synonym of Flavoscypha cantharella (Fr.) Harmaja, but Harmaja(3)(2009) considered Otidea concinna (Pers.) Sacc. to be a separate species from the original Peziza cantharella Fr. (a taiga species "with a European distribution essentially restricted to the northeastern part of the continent, with some occurrences on the mountains of Central Europe") and lists the two as separate species of Otidea. Also, Liu, C.Y.(1)(2006) presents molecular data indicating that Flavoscypha cantharella represents a genus inseparable from Otidea. At least one of their specimens of Flavoscypha cantharella had been identified as Otidea concinna, suggesting that they were using Harmaja's 1974 concept. To make things more complicated, Harmaja(3) considers the variability of Otidea concinna to have included two other species, Otidea integra (Bres.) Harmaja 1986 and Otidea subconcinna nom. prov., the latter a truncate rather than ear-shaped variation with subtle microscopic differences. Olariaga(1) describe an O. concinna clade that includes O. oregonensis, which they describe as a new species, and O. rainierensis. But in the absence of extant type material for Otidea concinna, they select a particular plate as lectotype, because it most closely resembles Persoon's description, "showing two or more large, convolute, caespitose, sessile, cup-shaped apothecia with a citrine (though light) outer surface." They assign only European collections to their concept. RANGE ^Otidea concinna has been reported in Washington, Idaho, and California, (Larsen), and Washington, Idaho, and Sweden, (Kanouse). One of the Washington specimens examined by Kanouse is however assigned to Otidea pseudoleporina by Olariaga(1) in their description of the latter as a new species, and the Idaho collection was originally assigned to O. leporina. There are collections designated as this species from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California at Oregon State University.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  rabbit-ears
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea leporina is characterized by an ear-shaped fruitbody that is brown inside and out and wide spores. (Olariaga(1)).^ | This name has been used for yellow fruitbodies in North America, but although it can be yellowish brown, the predominant colors are shades of brown - it is probably the most common Otidea species in the coniferous forests of Europe. Harmaja(3) comments (with Latin italicized), "According to Franchi et al. (1999) Peziza leporina Batsch : Fr. should be typified with a fungus that is currently known as Helvella silvicola (Beck ex Sacc.) Harmaja. The former name would be the oldest one for this fungus, and consequently these authors made the new combination Helvella leporina (Batsch : Fr.) Franchi, L. Lami & M. Marchetti. If this is accepted, a valid specific epithet for the present Otidea species should be searched for (if in existence)." RANGE ^Collections were examined from WA, OR, CA, CO, QC, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, (Olariaga(1)). Distribution may be much wider in North America. Besides var. typicus described below for WA, OR, CO, MD, and NY, Kanouse also records var. minor, with spores 8-11 x 5-6 um and smaller asci, from WA, OR, CA, Michigan, and NY. Olariaga(1) synonymized var. minor (Rehm) Sacc. with Otidea leporina, but it is not clear how they regard the Kanouse collections designated as var. minor.

SIMILAR  Otidea pseudoleporina shares ear-shaped fruitbody and resinous exudates on the outer surface that partly convert to heterogeneous reddish droplets in KOH, but differs in the ocher-orange to pinkish orange interior and smaller spores, (Olariaga(1)). Otidea onotica more commonly has a pinkish cast on the inner surface, averages larger, and has narrower spores. Otidea smithii has a grayish brown outer surface (Lincoff).

NAME ORIGIN  presumably after Professor John Axel Frithiof Nannfeldt, University of Uppsala, who published numerous papers on discomycetes and other fungi
SIMILAR  Otidea tuomikoskii is similar. 1) Warts are higher (55-177 um) and denser on the exterior of O. tuomikoskii than on the exterior of O. nannfeldtii which has warts 45-85 um high. 2) O. tuomikoskii has orange ocher to ocher basal tomentum, whereas O. nannfeldtii lacks orange tones in the basal tomentum which is white to light yellow or ocher. 3) Pink stains do occur in O. tuomikoskii but rarely. (The hymenium of O. nannfeldtii sometimes has pink tones or is entirely pinkish.) 4) In O. tuomikoskii (unlike O. nannfeldtii) the excipulum (exterior layer) turns yellow with KOH under the microscope though sometimes weakly. In recent fresh collections the reaction can be seen macroscopically. 5) The paraphyses of O. tuomikoskii sometimes have up to 2 shallow notches, which has not been observed to occur in O. nannfeldtii (rarely they do have slightly swollen areas). 6) Resinous exudates on surface cells of the exterior of O. tuomikoskii are yellow orange to yellow brown and the color does not change in KOH. Resinous exudates on the surface cells of the exterior of O. nannfeldtii are yellow brown and turn reddish brown in KOH. (Olariaga(1)). Otidea pseudoleporina has an ocher-orange to pinkish orange interior, narrowly to broadly ear-shaped young fruitbodies, and resinous exudates on the exterior dissolve partially to entirely into reddish gray heterogeneous drops in KOH.

LATIN NAME(S)  Otidea rainierensis  Kanouse^  Mycologia 41: 674. 1949
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea rainierensis is characterized by its relatively large size for an Otidea and paraphyses that are slender but enlarge abruptly into an almost spherical head.^ | Olariaga(1) suggest that Otidea kauffmanii Kanouse is a synonym, based on molecular and morphological study of both types. Their ITS sequences of the two types differ by only 4 base pairs. That would be a clue to the fresh colors of Otidea rainierensis, since the fresh outside (underside) of O. kauffmanii was described by Kanouse(4) as "chamois" to "ochraceous", and the fresh hymenium as "cream buff". The fruitbodies of O. kauffmanii were also described as 'yellowish tan to yellowish buff, concolorous', the 'concolorous' apparently referring to the exterior being the same color as the interior. Olariaga(1) believe that O. rainierensis does have yellow tones, as they observed small yellow resinous exudates in the type. Smaller spore size was described by Kanouse for O. kauffmanii - 8-10(12) x 5-6(7) um. Olariaga(1) measured the spore size of the type of O. kauffmanii at 11.5-12.5 x 5.5-6.5 um, the length of which overlaps their measurements for the type of O. rainierensis. RANGE ^Otidea rainierensis was described from a dried collection from WA, and there have been other reports since (Nancy Weber, pers. comm.). If O. kauffmanii is a synonym, it is also found at least in Michigan.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  tall rabbit's-ear
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea tuomikoskii is characterized by the narrowly ear-shaped fruitbody, with high warts on the outside, small spores, and the outer layer almost always turning yellow in KOH, together with the ocher to orange-ocher basal tomentum in dried specimens, (Olariaga(1)). The color is yellowish brown on outer and inner surfaces. It is associated with conifers and fruits most often among needle litter or even on very decayed wood.^ | The description is derived from Olariaga(1). RANGE ^Collections were examined from WA, OR, CA, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and Sweden, (Olariaga). It has also been found in Asia (Cao et al. 1990).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  ^"The yellow KOH reaction of the excipulum, especially strong in the subhymenium and ectal excipulum, has been observed to be constant, although weak in some collections. The KOH reaction is stronger in recent collections, and can also be macroscopically observed in fresh apothecia."

NAME ORIGIN  after R. Tuomikoski, the name associated with the type collection
SIMILAR  Otidea nannfeldtii is probably the closest species in appearance. 1) Warts are lower (45-85 um high) and less dense on the exterior of O. nannfeldtii than on the exterior of O. tuomikoskii which has warts 55-177 um high. 2) O. nannfeldtii lacks orange tones in basal tomentum which is white to light yellow or ocher whereas O. tuomikoskii has orange ocher to light ocher basal tomentum. 3) The hymenium sometimes has pink tones or is entirely pinkish in O. nannfeldtii. Pink stains do occur rarely in O. tuomikoskii. 4) In O. nannfeldtii the excipulum (exterior layer) does not turn yellow with KOH under the microscope. 5) The paraphyses of O. nannfeldtii do not have shallow notches (rarely they do have slightly swollen areas). 6) Resinous exudates on the surface cells of the exterior of O. nannfeldtii are yellow brown and turn reddish brown in KOH, whereas resinous exudates on surface cells of the exterior of O. tuomikoskii are yellow orange to yellow brown and the color does not change in KOH.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea unicisa is distinguished from all other species of Otidea by its delicately ornamented spore wall, (Harmaja 1986), but the species has not been established for the Pacific Northwest.^ | This name is being used, following Harmaja(3), as the most likely correct name for records of Otidea grandis (Pers.) Rehm Bull. Soc. mycol. Fr. 9: 111 (1893) or its synonym Scodellina grandis (Pers.) Seaver. According to Harmaja(3), Moravec(1994) considered it a Sowerbyella species, on the basis of that the secondary spore wall was persistent rather than temporary, but Harmaja disagreed, finding the excipular anatomy and split apothecium to be typical of Otidea and noting that it lacks the distinct stipe and hairs on the exterior typical of the Sowerbyella genus. The online Species Fungorum, accessed July 1, 2012, listed the current name as Sowerbyella unicisa (Peck) J. Moravec, Czech Mycol. 47(4): 266 (1995) [1994]. Olariaga(1) say that the name O. grandis has been used for O. unicisa in Kanouse(1949) as well as for O. bufonia, and they regard the name as a nomen dubium and confusum. They also say that O. unicisa has not been recorded outside eastern North America. RANGE ^Otidea grandis has been reported from Washington and Idaho in Larsen(1) (though not verified by either author). Kanouse gives the distribution as NY, NS, MI, and Europe. Phillips lists it for northeastern North America and Seaver(1) for CT to PA and WI as well as Europe. Harmaja saw specimens from MA, NH, NY, PA, and VT. Olariaga(1) examined collections from MA, MI, NC, NH, and WV and say it has not been recorded outside eastern North America. The type is from NY.

LATIN NAME(S)  Peziza cerea  Sowerby ex Merat^  Nouvelle Flore Paris 1: 25. 1821
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  We use the term Peziza varia group to cover Peziza varia itself, Peziza 'repanda' collections that are compatible with the description of Peziza varia, and Peziza cerea. We follow Hansen, K.(2) in regarding Peziza cerea as a synonym of Peziza varia, although it is maintained separately in the online Species Fungorum and MycoBank, each accessed February 28, 2018. K. Hansen et al. include Peziza cerea Fr. as a synonym (finding that moniliform paraphyses were a result of moisture and not taxonomically valuable). Features ascribed to Peziza cerea include 1) a fruitbody that is cup-shaped then expanded, the upper surface pale yellowish to saffron or yellowish brown, 2) whitish scurfy-downy exterior, 3) short stem, 4) growth on a variety of specialized substrates, and 5) microscopic characters.^ | Peziza cerea is placed in synonymy with P. varia by K. Hansen et al. (2002), who note that P. cerea Bull. is most likely P. vesiculosa. RANGE ^Peziza cerea is found at least in OR and NV, according to Larsen(1).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'waxy'
SIMILAR  Peziza varia has its paraphyses described differently: they are septate, with the individual cells "sometimes constricted at the septa, that is, arranged in a row to resemble a chain (moniliform), especially in older specimens", and P. varia has a "distinctly layered trama in which the middle layer of longitudinal hyphae appears under the lens as dark lines", (Breitenbach(1)). The two are considered synonymous by Hansen, K.(2) who write "Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly". Dennis describes the colors of the upper surface of P. varia and P. repanda differently: "light grey-brown at first but soon becoming dark greyish-brown" for P. varia, and "light chestnut brown" for P. repanda, (Dennis). See also SIMILAR section of Peziza arvernensis and Peziza 'repanda'.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  recurved cup, brown cup, spreading brown cup fungus
NOTES  We use the term Peziza varia group to cover Peziza varia itself, Peziza cerea (which can be considered a synonym of Peziza varia), and Peziza 'repanda' collections that are compatible with the description of Peziza varia. K. Hansen et al. comment about the use of this species concept, "Since the name lacks a type specimen and has been used inconsistently it is best treated as of uncertain application."^ |, and this is elaborated as follows: Persoon described the habitat as "in sylvaticis ad terram" [in the woods on the ground]. Fries used the name for a species on old trunks, primarily of Fagus [beech], but also included blackened soil as the substrate - some authors have followed one and some the other, and still others have used the name for a species occurring on soil and only exceptionally on wood, and in all cases the spores are smooth and are in the size range for Peziza varia. The descriptions below are for Peziza repanda Pers. (Seaver, Dennis), Peziza repanda Pers.: Fr. (Hansen), or authority not given (Arora). Many records of P. repanda can be considered Peziza varia. RANGE ^P. 'repanda' is found at least in BC, WA, OR, ID, and also CA, CO, MT, WY, (Larsen for Peziza repanda Pers. ex Pers.), CA (Arora), NY to IA and MD, also Europe, (Seaver), Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, (Hansen), and United Kingdom (Dennis).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  ^
UPPER SURFACE  4-13cm across or occasionally larger, "cup-shaped when young but expanding to nearly flat or often wavy (undulating), the margin often splitting"; spore-bearing upper surface pale brown to medium brown, tan, or when old somewhat darker, "smooth to somewhat wrinkled or convoluted at the center"^, (Arora), reaching 8-10cm across, at first cup-shaped, the margin even or crenate [scalloped], expanding and becoming repand, the margin remaining entire or splitting, regular in outline or irregularly revolute; upper surface concave becoming flat or convex, pale brown, becoming darker when old, (Seaver), occasionally up to 12cm across, "cup-shaped, becoming expanded and undulating"; spore-bearing upper surface light chestnut brown; margin often crenate [scalloped], (Dennis), 1-4cm across, cup-shaped then expanded; upper surface pale brownish, (Hansen)

NAME ORIGIN  means "wavy", "folded" in Latin^, (Schalkwijk-Barendsen)
SIMILAR  The flesh of P. repanda is stratified like that of Peziza varia but the disc is a different shade of brown (P. varia being "light grey-brown at first but soon becoming dark greyish-brown") and the peculiar moniliform paraphyses of P. varia are lacking, (Dennis). Peziza varia and Peziza cerea cannot be differentiated clearly on field characters, (Lincoff(2)). Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly, (Hansen, K.). Dennis also describes the colors of the upper surface of P. cerea differently: "pale ochraceous or yellowish-brown" (Dennis).

Peziza varia group are common in the Pacific Northwest.^ | We use the term Peziza varia group to cover Peziza varia itself, Peziza cerea (which can be considered synonym of Peziza varia), and Peziza 'repanda' collections that are compatible with the description of Peziza varia. K. Hansen et al. comment about the use of the species concept of Peziza repanda, "Since the name lacks a type specimen and has been used inconsistently it is best treated as of uncertain application." K. Hansen et al. include Peziza cerea Fr. as a synonym (finding that moniliform paraphyses were a result of moisture and not taxonomically valuable), and point out the ambiguities in the various concepts of the similar Peziza repanda, a name they treat as "of uncertain application". The molecular study of Medardi(1) showed that collections in a clade representing Peziza varia grew on a wide variety of habitats including herbivore dung. RANGE ^Peziza varia is found at least in ID (Larsen), Switzerland (Breitenbach), United Kingdom (Dennis), Finland and Sweden, (Hansen, L.(1)), Italy and Russia (Medardi), and OR, MA, Denmark, Finland, Russia, and the United Kingdom, (Hansen, K.).

SIMILAR  Peziza cerea has different paraphyses (Breitenbach). Dennis describes the color of P. cerea differently as "pale ochraceous or yellowish brown" on the upper surface, (Dennis). Peziza repanda has slightly less gray color and spores are smooth, (Arora). Peziza repanda and Peziza cerea cannot be differentiated clearly in the field (Lincoff(2)). Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly, (Hansen, K.). Dennis also describes the colors of the upper surface of P. repanda differently, as "light chestnut brown" (Dennis). Peziza fimetii resembles P. varia in color but has larger spores measuring (18)20-22.5 x 10-12 um "and a medullary excipulum composed of a single textura globulosa layer" with 50-100 um broad cells, (Medardi).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Phylloscypha phyllogena produces large cup-shaped, stalkless fruitbodies that are purple-brown to red-brown to olive-brown on the upper surface, paler and scurfy-granular on the lower surface, growing on soil or decaying wood, with finely warty spores.^ |Phylloscypha phyllogena (as P. badio-confusa Korf) was distinguished from P. badia [now Legaliana badia] in 1954 by Korf: speaking of P. badio-confusa Korf, he said, "This species is almost invariably determined in America as Peziza badia [name in italics], and certainly is that figured by Seaver... under this name. It is perhaps our commonest large cup-fungus, and it seems to me that it must have been described before 1897 by some European or American author, but I have seen no types which match it. The true P. badia [name in italics] has reticulate spore-markings, as shown by Le Gal". (Korf(5)). |Elliott & Kaufert in 1974 redescribed both of these species microscopically, refining the distinction between the two species: Peziza phyllogena [now Phylloscypha phyllogena] had spores with "walls finely roughened, with warts about 0.5 um in height, frequently smooth at ends of mature spores as primary wall remains attached (apiculus)", whereas P. badia had spores "ornamented with short predominantly longitudinal ridges which unite to form an incomplete and irregular reticulum, ridges about 0.5 um in height, apiculus not seen" (with the letter mu used for um); if the fruitbody was found on downed wood rather than on the ground it was much more likely to be P. phyllogena although occasional collections of P. badia are found on wood, P. phyllogena was collected from May 18 to July 26 in Canada and from March 28 to June 25 in the US (excluding AK), [although Ginns examined a September 12 collection from ON and cites a September collection from AK], whereas P. badia was collected from July 18 to October 25 in Canada and from June 21 to October 5 in the US. (Elliott, M.E.(2)). RANGE ^Phylloscypha phyllogena was examined (as Peziza phyllogena) from BC, ON, PQ, AK, MA, NY, MD, and PA, (Elliott, M.E.(2)). Phylloscypha phyllogena was reported (as Peziza phyllogena) from BC, WA, OR, ID, CA, and UT, (Larsen as P. badioconfusa).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Legaliana badia is very similar but "its spores have a delicate irregular reticulum versus the finely warted spores" of Peziza phyllogena and its synonym Peziza badioconfusa, (Beug(3)). Peziza kalloi Harmaja has also been confused with P. badioconfusa and occurs at least in northern Europe and AK: it differs from P. badioconfusa in the conspicuous bright violet basal mycelium, shorter (15-19 x 7.5-10 um) and elliptic spores, spore ornamentation consisting "of warts that vary somewhat in size throughout the spore", being +/- distinctly larger at the spore ends, "the habitat (usually) in moist or wet rich woods and bushes, especially by brooks", mostly in decaying hardwood, the fruiting in summer and fall, and the pronounced boreal distribution, (Harmaja(4)).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  jellylike black urn, black cup-fungus, orange-dusted cup
NOTES  The Plectania melastoma group has three members, two of them being found in the Pacific Northwest: P. harnischii and P. melastoma. Many or most of the PNW collections are P. harnischii. Features include 1) a cup-shaped fruitbody up to 3cm wide, 2) an incurved cup margin, 3) a blackish inner surface, 4) a black and wrinkled outer surface with fine exterior orange granules especially near the margin, 5) tough flesh, 6) absent stem or a short narrowed base, 7) growth on the ground or on sticks and other debris of both hardwoods and conifers in spring, and 8) microscopic characters including elliptic or spindle-shaped spores and inamyloid asci.^ |The group is defined by among Plectania species by very minutely verrucose spores at 100X under oil immersion in cotton blue, and a tendency to have orange granules near the cup margin. The third member is Plectania zugazae, so far only known from Spain, Greece, and Cyprus, and differentiated morphologically by having mature spores greater than 12 um wide. P. zugazae may lack orange granules and when present they are often restricted to the margin. The main morphological difference between the two Pacific Northwest species is also spore width, 8-10(11) um for P. harnischii and 10-12(12.5) um for P. melastoma. |The main illustration here is Plectania harnischii TUR-A 209455, collected and photographed in Oregon and sequenced for the phylogenetic tree in Carbone(3). The other illustrations could be either species. |Of the collections in the phylogenetic tree from the Pacific Northwest including Montana, six were P. harnischii. Under "Studied and/or sequenced collections" two collections were cited from Washington, although other sequences from elsewhere in the USA are found in the phylogenetic tree. RANGE ^Plectania harnischii was sequenced from MT (holotype), WA, and OR, (Carbone(3)). Plectania melastoma was sequenced from USA including at least 2 from WA, Canada (one from uncultured Pezizomycotina in British Columbia, the other from uncultured fungus clone in Alberta), Europe (many countries), Mexico, Japan, and China.

SIMILAR  Plectania milleri has a stellate margin (with star-like points), and no orange granules, (Arora). P. milleri "differs from P. melastoma in its stellate margin, dark hyphae penetrating the medullary excipulum, and smooth tomentum hyphae. In P. melastoma the margin is entire or slightly split but is never stellate, the tomentum hyphae are encrusted with orange granules, and there are no dark hyphae in the medullary excipulum", (Paden). P. milleri has spores that are smooth even at 100X in oil immersion, measuring 22-31 x (8)9-11 um, with "dark hyphae running from the external layer into the medullary excipulum", (Carbone). |Pseudoplectania nigrella and Pseudoplectania melaena have round spores and no orange granules. |See also SIMILAR section of Donadinia nigrella.

NAME ORIGIN  named after Orson K. Miller, who collected the type material
SIMILAR  "Plectania milleri differs from P. melastoma in its stellate margin, dark hyphae penetrating the medullary excipulum, and smooth tomentum hyphae. In P. melastoma the margin is entire or slightly split but is never stellate, the tomentum hyphae are encrusted with orange granules, and there are no dark hyphae in the medullary excipulum", (Paden). Pseudoplectania melaena differs in having round spores, and fruiting on dead twigs and branches of conifers in early spring. With immature specimens this species is very similar to round-spored Pseudoplectania nigrella, but at this stage spores may not be obtainable: with mature specimens the larger cup size and stellate margin of P. milleri and the marginal hairs of P. nigrella are sufficient to distinguish them, (Maguire). Donadinia nigrella has a long stem, a cup that lacks the toothed edge, an exterior that is less hairy, and spores that are slightly larger, (Trudell). Urnula padeniana and Pseudosarcosoma latahense are more gelatinized.

NOTES  Pseudoplectania melaena is a dark brown to blackish cup sparingly clothed with straight or slightly flexuous [wavy] hairs, with a stem of variable length up to 3cm, growing on wood under conifers, and with microscopic characters including smooth, round spores and paraphyses that are hooked or coiled at the tips.^ | This taxon has also been known in North America as Pseudoplectania vogesiaca (Pers.) Seaver, but Van Vooren(1) make a strong case for the name we are using. Carbone(1) gives molecular evidence for the separation of Pseudoplectania (including Pseudoplectania melaena) from Plectania. The online Species Fungorum and MycoBank, accessed March 18, 2018, gave Pseudoplectania melaena as a synonym of Plectania melaena (Fr.) Paden, in Korf, Mycotaxon 14(1): 1 (1982), and Pseudoplectania vogesiaca is listed separately, but it is not clear why the two are separately listed or why Pseudoplectania melaena has reverted to Plectania.

NOTES  Features include minute grayish, tomentose-powdery, cylindric or cup-shaped fruitbodies crowded together on a grayish mat and microscopic characters including round spores, basidia, gelatinous context, clamp connections, and diverticulate hairs and crystals.^ | Some authors call the epithet "poriiforme", based on Article 60.8 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (2000) which appears to suggest that the compound should be corrected, but Thorn(4) provides the rationale that Article 60G.1(b) allows the compounding form "ae" to indicate the origin of the name, being a reference to the genus Poria rather than porus. Resupinatus poriaeformis has been recorded from BC, also AL, MD, MN, NC, NJ, SC, France, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, according to Redhead who notes concerning the BC record, "Cooke (1957) has recorded this species from British Columbia. However, Donk (1962) was of the opinion that a number of taxa other than S. poriaeforme had been placed in synonymy by Cooke, e.g., S. incanum Kalchbr. and S. conspersum (Pers.) Donk. Until the collections examined by Cooke are rechecked, the exact identity of the one collection from British Columbia will not be known.". Redhead goes on to illustrate hyphal ends on the cup margin of a BC collection of this species in the sense of Donk, (see MICROSCOPIC). (Redhead(21)).

SIMILAR  Another cup species apparently limited to Juncus is Lachnum apalum (Berk. & Broome) Nannf. Haines(1) reported this species from the University of Washington Arboretum in his Masters of Science thesis (as Dasyscyphus hapalus which should be Dasyscyphus apalus). He says it is up to 0.1cm across, up to 0.15cm high, white with a slight reddish tinge, covered by hairs when dry. The stem is up to 0.1cm x 0.02cm. Spores measuring 30-40 x 1.5 um are colorless, 1-septate or more, filled with refractive droplets, 6-8 spores parallel in an ascus that measures 50-65 x 5-7 um. Paraphyses are lanceolate, colorless, usually without refractive droplets, up to 20 um longer than asci, 2.5-3 um at widest point. Colorless hairs are 2.5-3 um wide, up to 100 um long, 0-2-septate, and densely covered with minute granules. The excipulum is composed of colorless, relatively thin-walled prismatic cells measuring approximately 12 x 8 um. It is also described on dead Juncus in Dennis(1) as very common in Britain. Dennis(1) says Dasyscyphus diminutus with spores 10-15 um long and Dasyscyphus fugiens with spores 6-8 um long also occur on dead Juncus. A number of other Sclerotinia species occur in the Pacific Northwest: the herbarium at the University of British Columbia has collections from BC named as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (6) and Sclerotinia trifoliorum (2) (as well as several now considered to be in other genera).

SIMILAR  Tympanis hysterioides, considered by Groves as a variety of T. alnea, occurs on the same host (alder), but T. hysterioides differs "in having one-septate ascospores and ultimate cells which are intermediate in size between those of T. alnea and T. pseudoalnea. The apothecia are pale brown when sectioned and hysteriform in outline; this, however, is mainly due to their gregarious habit: the few solitary apothecia remain orbicular.", (Ouellette). Other species of Tympanis with collections from the Pacific Northwest in Groves(1) or Ouellette(1) are either not growing on alder or are not grayish-pruinose.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Tympanis confusa also grows on pine but primary ascospores are more than 2-septate. Tympanis laricina can also occur pine, fir, and spruce, but spores are characteristically clavate, sometimes very narrowly so, and germinate at each end into tufts of subglobose, ovoid, or pyriform cells, producing short, allantoid, almost rod-shaped ultimate cells, whereas T. hypopodia spores are elliptic-fusoid, sometimes subclavate and curved, narrow or wide, and bud off ovoid cells from each tip during germination, the ultimate cells allantoid and apparently slightly longer than those of T. laricina, (Ouellette). When T. hypopodia occurs on Abies it can be confused also with Tympanis truncatula (primary ascospores broadly elliptic to nearly round).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Tympanis alnea occurs on the same host (alder), but T. hysterioides differs "in having one-septate ascospores and ultimate cells which are intermediate in size between those of T. alnea and T. pseudoalnea. The apothecia are pale brown when sectioned and hysteriform in outline; this, however, is mainly due to their gregarious habit; the few solitary apothecia remain orbicular." The ultimate cells, the last in the series of buddings from the germinating spore are less than 1 um in diameter in T. pseudoalnea. (Ouellette).

P. latahense is smaller (up to about 4cm instead of up to 10cm), "less gelatinous, with the gelatin diminishing greatly as the fruitbodies age", the cups "with a gray, rather than black, exterior", and has spores 24-37 x 9-12 um and lacking oil droplets at maturity, (Trudell). Sarcosoma globosum (jelly pots) has been reported from "In the rain forests of Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park, British Columbia" by Curtis Randall Bjork who posted a video on Facebook seen June 25, 2017. He wrote "This ascomycete has a more or less spherical stalk that is filled with a liquid gel. The spore-bearing part is the disc on top. This species is rare in Europe." In the comments about this posting, Andy McKinnon noted, " I've seen this species once before, about three decades ago, just outside Prince George [BC]. It's distinctive and remarkable." The appearance in the video does not closely resemble other photos that depict a hymenium located in a depression on the upper part of the fruitbody. In the video some of the fruitbodies have developed an everted disc. In addition to its occurrence in Europe, Sarcosoma globosum (the same as Bulgaria globosa but not Sarcoleotia globosa) is said to be rare in northeastern North America.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) a tiny, dark green, lens-shaped to cushion-shaped, gelatinous fruitbody, slightly even on the surface and shiny when wet, 2) absent stem, 3) growth on rotten hardwood, and 4) cylindric to fusiform spores which quickly form secondary spores.^ | This collection with three illustrations was probably identified on the basis of its similarity to the description in Breitenbach(1), including similar primary spore size and the presence of secondary spores. Breitenbach(1) mention that their primary spore size was shorter than other measurements in the literature, "During the formation of secondary spores in the ascus, typical for C. atrovirens, the eight primary spores break up. The primary spores measured by us fall significantly short of the measurements given in the lit. (Rehm 1896: 15-25 x 3.5-5 um, Grelet 1932 - 1959: 20-35 x 4-5 um, Dennis 1956: 15-28 x 3.5-5 um). The formation of secondary spores nevertheless allows, in our opinion, no other interpretation (poorly developed spores?)." (Latin names italicized, mu used instead of u in measurement unit). The description here is derived from Breitenbach(1). RANGE ^The illustrated collection from BC was deposited at the University of British Columbia (F24156).
